may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2017-5754
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    Intel processors, enabling an attacker controlling an
    unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other
    processes running on the system.

  This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the
  Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set named
  Kernel Page Table Isolation, enforcing a near complete separation of
  the kernel and userspace address maps and preventing the attack.
  This solution might have a performance impact, and can be disabled
  at boot time by passing pti=off to the kernel command line.

  - CVE-2017-8824
    Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation
    did not correctly manage resources when a socket is
    disconnected and reconnected, potentially leading to a
    use-after-free. A local user could use this for denial
    of service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation. On systems that do not already
    have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated by
    disabling it:echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf
    install dccp false

  - CVE-2017-15868
    Al Viro found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation
    Protocol (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type
    of the second socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(),
    which could lead to memory corruption. A local user with
    the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can use this for denial of
    service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-16538
    Andrey Konovalov reported that the dvb-usb-lmedm04 media
    driver did not correctly handle some error conditions
    during initialisation. A physically present user with a
    specially designed USB device can use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

  - CVE-2017-16939
    Mohamed Ghannam reported (through Beyond Security's
    SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program) that the IPsec
    (xfrm) implementation did not correctly handle some
    failure cases when dumping policy information through
    netlink. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-17448
    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netfilter subsystem
    allowed users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user namespace, not just the root namespace, to enable
    and disable connection tracking helpers. This could lead
    to denial of service, violation of network security
    policy, or have other impact.

  - CVE-2017-17449
    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netlink subsystem
    allowed users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user namespace to monitor netlink traffic in all net
    namespaces, not just those owned by that user namespace.
    This could lead to exposure of sensitive information.

  - CVE-2017-17450
    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the xt_osf module allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace to modify the global OS fingerprint list.

  - CVE-2017-17558
    Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not
    correctly handle some error conditions during
    initialisation. A physically present user with a
    specially designed USB device can use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-17741
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for
    x86 would over-read data from memory when emulating an
    MMIO write if the kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled. A
    guest virtual machine might be able to use this to cause
    a denial of service (crash).

  - CVE-2017-17805
    It was discovered that some implementations of the
    Salsa20 block cipher did not correctly handle
    zero-length input. A local user could use this to cause
    a denial of service (crash) or possibly have other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2017-17806
    It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be
    used with an underlying hash algorithm that requires a
    key, which was not intended. A local user could use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption), or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-17807
    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a
    check for write permission when adding keys to a
    process's default keyring. A local user could use this
    to cause a denial of service or to obtain sensitive
    information.

  - CVE-2017-1000407
    Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors allowed direct access to host I/O port
    0x80, which is not generally safe. On some systems this
    allows a guest VM to cause a denial of service (crash)
    of the host.

  - CVE-2017-1000410
    Ben Seri reported that the Bluetooth subsystem did not
    correctly handle short EFS information elements in L2CAP
    messages. An attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth
    could use this to obtain sensitive information from the
    kernel.","Upgrade the linux packages.

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2017-5754
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    Intel processors, enabling an attacker controlling an
    unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other
    processes running on the system.

  This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the
  Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set named
  Kernel Page Table Isolation, enforcing a near complete separation of
  the kernel and userspace address maps and preventing the attack.
  This solution might have a performance impact, and can be disabled
  at boot time by passing pti=off to the kernel command line.

  - CVE-2017-8824
    Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation
    did not correctly manage resources when a socket is
    disconnected and reconnected, potentially leading to a
    use-after-free. A local user could use this for denial
    of service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation. On systems that do not already
    have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated by
    disabling it:echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf
    install dccp false

  - CVE-2017-15868
    Al Viro found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation
    Protocol (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type
    of the second socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(),
    which could lead to memory corruption. A local user with
    the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can use this for denial of
    service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-16538
    Andrey Konovalov reported that the dvb-usb-lmedm04 media
    driver did not correctly handle some error conditions
    during initialisation. A physically present user with a
    specially designed USB device can use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

  - CVE-2017-16939
    Mohamed Ghannam reported (through Beyond Security's
    SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program) that the IPsec
    (xfrm) implementation did not correctly handle some
    failure cases when dumping policy information through
    netlink. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-17448
    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netfilter subsystem
    allowed users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user namespace, not just the root namespace, to enable
    and disable connection tracking helpers. This could lead
    to denial of service, violation of network security
    policy, or have other impact.

  - CVE-2017-17449
    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netlink subsystem
    allowed users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user namespace to monitor netlink traffic in all net
    namespaces, not just those owned by that user namespace.
    This could lead to exposure of sensitive information.

  - CVE-2017-17450
    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the xt_osf module allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace to modify the global OS fingerprint list.

  - CVE-2017-17558
    Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not
    correctly handle some error conditions during
    initialisation. A physically present user with a
    specially designed USB device can use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-17741
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for
    x86 would over-read data from memory when emulating an
    MMIO write if the kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled. A
    guest virtual machine might be able to use this to cause
    a denial of service (crash).

  - CVE-2017-17805
    It was discovered that some implementations of the
    Salsa20 block cipher did not correctly handle
    zero-length input. A local user could use this to cause
    a denial of service (crash) or possibly have other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2017-17806
    It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be
    used with an underlying hash algorithm that requires a
    key, which was not intended. A local user could use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption), or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-17807
    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a
    check for write permission when adding keys to a
    process's default keyring. A local user could use this
    to cause a denial of service or to obtain sensitive
    information.

  - CVE-2017-1000407
    Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors allowed direct access to host I/O port
    0x80, which is not generally safe. On some systems this
    allows a guest VM to cause a denial of service (crash)
    of the host.

  - CVE-2017-1000410
    Ben Seri reported that the Bluetooth subsystem did not
    correctly handle short EFS information elements in L2CAP
    messages. An attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth
    could use this to obtain sensitive information from the
    kernel.","Upgrade the linux packages.

  - CVE-2017-5754
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    Intel processors, enabling an attacker controlling an
    unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other
    processes running on the system.

  This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2017-5754
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    Intel processors, enabling an attacker controlling an
    unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other
    processes running on the system.

  This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the
  Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set named
  Kernel Page Table Isolation, enforcing a near complete separation of
  the kernel and userspace address maps and preventing the attack.
  This solution might have a performance impact, and can be disabled
  at boot time by passing pti=off to the kernel command line.

  - CVE-2017-8824
    Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation
    did not correctly manage resources when a socket is
    disconnected and reconnected, potentially leading to a
    use-after-free. A local user could use this for denial
    of service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation. On systems that do not already
    have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated by
    disabling it:echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf
    install dccp false

  - CVE-2017-15868
    Al Viro found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation
    Protocol (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type
    of the second socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(),
    which could lead to memory corruption. A local user with
    the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can use this for denial of
    service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-16538
    Andrey Konovalov reported that the dvb-usb-lmedm04 media
    driver did not correctly handle some error conditions
    during initialisation. A physically present user with a
    specially designed USB device can use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

  - CVE-2017-16939
    Mohamed Ghannam reported (through Beyond Security's
    SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program) that the IPsec
    (xfrm) implementation did not correctly handle some
    failure cases when dumping policy information through
    netlink. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-17448
    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netfilter subsystem
    allowed users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user namespace, not just the root namespace, to enable
    and disable connection tracking helpers. This could lead
    to denial of service, violation of network security
    policy, or have other impact.

  - CVE-2017-17449
    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netlink subsystem
    allowed users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user namespace to monitor netlink traffic in all net
    namespaces, not just those owned by that user namespace.
    This could lead to exposure of sensitive information.

  - CVE-2017-17450
    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the xt_osf module allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace to modify the global OS fingerprint list.

  - CVE-2017-17558
    Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not
    correctly handle some error conditions during
    initialisation. A physically present user with a
    specially designed USB device can use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-17741
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for
    x86 would over-read data from memory when emulating an
    MMIO write if the kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled. A
    guest virtual machine might be able to use this to cause
    a denial of service (crash).

  - CVE-2017-17805
    It was discovered that some implementations of the
    Salsa20 block cipher did not correctly handle
    zero-length input. A local user could use this to cause
    a denial of service (crash) or possibly have other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2017-17806
    It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be
    used with an underlying hash algorithm that requires a
    key, which was not intended. A local user could use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption), or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-17807
    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a
    check for write permission when adding keys to a
    process's default keyring. A local user could use this
    to cause a denial of service or to obtain sensitive
    information.

  - CVE-2017-1000407
    Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors allowed direct access to host I/O port
    0x80, which is not generally safe. On some systems this
    allows a guest VM to cause a denial of service (crash)
    of the host.

  - CVE-2017-1000410
    Ben Seri reported that the Bluetooth subsystem did not
    correctly handle short EFS information elements in L2CAP
    messages. An attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth
    could use this to obtain sensitive information from the
    kernel.","Upgrade the linux packages.

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    Intel processors, enabling an attacker controlling an
    unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other
    processes running on the system.

  This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the

  Kernel Page Table Isolation, enforcing a near complete separation of
  the kernel and userspace address maps and preventing the attack.
  This solution might have a performance impact, and can be disabled
  at boot time by passing pti=off to the kernel command line.

  - CVE-2017-5715
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    various processors supporting speculative execution,
    enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process
    to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750
    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a
    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.
    A local user with access to files on a hugetlbfs
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause
    a denial of service or remote code execution in the
    client.

  - CVE-2018-1000004
    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This
    could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-1000199
    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did
    not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.
    Local users can use this to cause a denial of service,
    or possibly for privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and
    i386) and possibly other architectures.","Upgrade the linux packages.

    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750
    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a
    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.
    A local user with access to files on a hugetlbfs
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause
    a denial of service or remote code execution in the
    client.

  - CVE-2018-1000004
    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This
    could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-1000199
    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did
    not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.
    Local users can use this to cause a denial of service,
    or possibly for privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and
    i386) and possibly other architectures.","Upgrade the linux packages.

    operations, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local user could use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18232
    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem, between probing and
    destroying a port. This could lead to a deadlock. A
    physically present attacker could use this to cause a
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18241
    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not
    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750
    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a
    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.
    A local user with access to files on a hugetlbfs
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause
    a denial of service or remote code execution in the
    client.

  - CVE-2018-1000004
    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This
    could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-1000199
    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did
    not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.
    Local users can use this to cause a denial of service,
    or possibly for privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and
    i386) and possibly other architectures.","Upgrade the linux packages.

    potentially leading to a use-after-free. If this module
    is loaded, it could be used by a remote attacker for
    denial of service or possibly for code execution.

  - CVE-2017-18203
    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in
    creation and deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices. A
    local user could potentially use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18216
    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to
    hold a necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file
    operations, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local user could use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18232
    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem, between probing and
    destroying a port. This could lead to a deadlock. A
    physically present attacker could use this to cause a
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18241
    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not
    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750
    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a
    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.
    A local user with access to files on a hugetlbfs
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause
    a denial of service or remote code execution in the
    client.

  - CVE-2018-1000004
    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This
    could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-1000199
    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did
    not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.
    Local users can use this to cause a denial of service,
    or possibly for privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and
    i386) and possibly other architectures.","Upgrade the linux packages.

    denial of service or possibly for code execution.

  - CVE-2017-18203
    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in
    creation and deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices. A
    local user could potentially use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18216
    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to
    hold a necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file
    operations, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local user could use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18232
    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem, between probing and
    destroying a port. This could lead to a deadlock. A

    denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18241
    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not
    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750

    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.
    A local user with access to files on a hugetlbfs
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause
    a denial of service or remote code execution in the
    client.

  - CVE-2018-1000004
    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This
    could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-1000199
    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did
    not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.
    Local users can use this to cause a denial of service,
    or possibly for privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and
    i386) and possibly other architectures.","Upgrade the linux packages.

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to perform a range check on a received packet
    header field, leading to an out-of-bounds read. A remote
    user able to connect to the USB/IP server could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16913
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to perform a range check on a received packet
    header field, leading to excessive memory allocation. A
    remote user able to connect to the USB/IP server could
    use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16914
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to check for an invalid combination of fields in
    a received packet, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A remote user able to connect to the USB/IP
    server could use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18017
    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter
    xt_TCPMSS module failed to validate TCP header lengths,
    potentially leading to a use-after-free. If this module
    is loaded, it could be used by a remote attacker for
    denial of service or possibly for code execution.

  - CVE-2017-18203
    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in
    creation and deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices. A
    local user could potentially use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18216
    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to
    hold a necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file
    operations, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local user could use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18232
    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem, between probing and
    destroying a port. This could lead to a deadlock. A
    physically present attacker could use this to cause a
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18241
    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not
    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750
    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a
    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.
    A local user with access to files on a hugetlbfs
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause
    a denial of service or remote code execution in the
    client.

  - CVE-2018-1000004
    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This
    could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-1000199
    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did
    not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.
    Local users can use this to cause a denial of service,
    or possibly for privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and
    i386) and possibly other architectures.","Upgrade the linux packages.

    ensuring user-provided buffers always point to userland
    memory were disabled, allowing destination addresses to
    be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a local user with
    access to a suitable video device can exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2017-13220

  - CVE-2017-18241
    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not
    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with

    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause
    a denial of service or remote code execution in the
    client.

  - CVE-2018-1000004
    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This
    could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-1000199
    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did
    not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.

  (array bounds checking followed by array access) and replacing the
  array access with the speculation-safe array_index_nospec()
  function.

    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-5753
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    various processors supporting speculative execution,
    enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process
    to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the
    system.

  This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1 (bounds-check
  bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable code sections
  (array bounds checking followed by array access) and replacing the
  array access with the speculation-safe array_index_nospec()
  function.

  More use sites will be added over time.

  - CVE-2017-13166
    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2
    ioctl handling code has been found. Memory protections
    ensuring user-provided buffers always point to userland
    memory were disabled, allowing destination addresses to
    be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a local user with
    access to a suitable video device can exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2017-13220

    denial of service or possibly for code execution.

  - CVE-2017-18203
    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in
    creation and deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices. A
    local user could potentially use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18216
    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to
    hold a necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file
    operations, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local user could use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18232
    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem, between probing and
    destroying a port. This could lead to a deadlock. A
    physically present attacker could use this to cause a
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18241
    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not
    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750
    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a
    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.

    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause

  - CVE-2017-0861
    Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the
    ALSA (sound) PCM core. We believe this was not possible
    in practice.

  - CVE-2017-5715
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    various processors supporting speculative execution,
    enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process
    to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the
    system.

  This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch target
  injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64 and
  i386) by using the 'retpoline' compiler feature which allows
  indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

  - CVE-2017-5753
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    various processors supporting speculative execution,
    enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process
    to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the
    system.

  This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1 (bounds-check
  bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable code sections
  (array bounds checking followed by array access) and replacing the
  array access with the speculation-safe array_index_nospec()
  function.

  More use sites will be added over time.

  - CVE-2017-13166
    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2
    ioctl handling code has been found. Memory protections
    ensuring user-provided buffers always point to userland
    memory were disabled, allowing destination addresses to
    be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a local user with
    access to a suitable video device can exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2017-13220

    xt_TCPMSS module failed to validate TCP header lengths,
    potentially leading to a use-after-free. If this module
    is loaded, it could be used by a remote attacker for
    denial of service or possibly for code execution.

  - CVE-2017-18203
    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in
    creation and deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices. A
    local user could potentially use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18216
    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to
    hold a necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file
    operations, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local user could use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18232
    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem, between probing and
    destroying a port. This could lead to a deadlock. A
    physically present attacker could use this to cause a
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18241
    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not
    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750
    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a
    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.

    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2015-9016
    Ming Lei reported a race condition in the multiqueue
    block layer (blk-mq). On a system with a driver using
    blk-mq (mtip32xx, null_blk, or virtio_blk), a local user
    might be able to use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-0861
    Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the
    ALSA (sound) PCM core. We believe this was not possible
    in practice.

  - CVE-2017-5715
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    various processors supporting speculative execution,
    enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process
    to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the
    system.

  This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch target
  injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64 and
  i386) by using the 'retpoline' compiler feature which allows
  indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

  - CVE-2017-5753
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    various processors supporting speculative execution,
    enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process
    to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the
    system.

  This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1 (bounds-check
  bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable code sections
  (array bounds checking followed by array access) and replacing the
  array access with the speculation-safe array_index_nospec()
  function.

  More use sites will be added over time.

  - CVE-2017-13166
    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2
    ioctl handling code has been found. Memory protections
    ensuring user-provided buffers always point to userland
    memory were disabled, allowing destination addresses to
    be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a local user with
    access to a suitable video device can exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2017-13220
    Al Viro reported that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation
    could dereference a pointer before performing the
    necessary type check. A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16526
    Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may
    dereference an invalid pointer in an error case. A local
    user might be able to use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16911
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd
    driver exposed kernel heap addresses to local users.
    This information could aid the exploitation of other
    vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2017-16912
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to perform a range check on a received packet
    header field, leading to an out-of-bounds read. A remote
    user able to connect to the USB/IP server could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16913
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to perform a range check on a received packet
    header field, leading to excessive memory allocation. A
    remote user able to connect to the USB/IP server could
    use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16914
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to check for an invalid combination of fields in
    a received packet, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A remote user able to connect to the USB/IP
    server could use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18017
    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter
    xt_TCPMSS module failed to validate TCP header lengths,
    potentially leading to a use-after-free. If this module
    is loaded, it could be used by a remote attacker for
    denial of service or possibly for code execution.

  - CVE-2017-18203
    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in
    creation and deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices. A
    local user could potentially use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18216
    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to
    hold a necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file
    operations, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local user could use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18232
    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem, between probing and
    destroying a port. This could lead to a deadlock. A
    physically present attacker could use this to cause a
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18241
    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not
    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750
    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a
    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.
    A local user with access to files on a hugetlbfs
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause
    a denial of service or remote code execution in the
    client.

  - CVE-2018-1000004
    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This
    could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-1000199
    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did
    not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.
    Local users can use this to cause a denial of service,
    or possibly for privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and
    i386) and possibly other architectures.","Upgrade the linux packages.

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2015-9016
    Ming Lei reported a race condition in the multiqueue
    block layer (blk-mq). On a system with a driver using
    blk-mq (mtip32xx, null_blk, or virtio_blk), a local user
    might be able to use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-0861
    Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the
    ALSA (sound) PCM core. We believe this was not possible
    in practice.

  - CVE-2017-5715
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    various processors supporting speculative execution,
    enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process
    to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the
    system.

  This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch target
  injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64 and
  i386) by using the 'retpoline' compiler feature which allows
  indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

  - CVE-2017-5753
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    various processors supporting speculative execution,
    enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process
    to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the
    system.

  This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1 (bounds-check
  bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable code sections
  (array bounds checking followed by array access) and replacing the
  array access with the speculation-safe array_index_nospec()
  function.

  More use sites will be added over time.

  - CVE-2017-13166
    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2
    ioctl handling code has been found. Memory protections
    ensuring user-provided buffers always point to userland
    memory were disabled, allowing destination addresses to
    be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a local user with
    access to a suitable video device can exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2017-13220
    Al Viro reported that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation
    could dereference a pointer before performing the
    necessary type check. A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16526
    Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may
    dereference an invalid pointer in an error case. A local
    user might be able to use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16911
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd
    driver exposed kernel heap addresses to local users.
    This information could aid the exploitation of other
    vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2017-16912
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to perform a range check on a received packet
    header field, leading to an out-of-bounds read. A remote
    user able to connect to the USB/IP server could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16913
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to perform a range check on a received packet
    header field, leading to excessive memory allocation. A
    remote user able to connect to the USB/IP server could
    use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16914
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to check for an invalid combination of fields in
    a received packet, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A remote user able to connect to the USB/IP
    server could use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18017
    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter
    xt_TCPMSS module failed to validate TCP header lengths,
    potentially leading to a use-after-free. If this module
    is loaded, it could be used by a remote attacker for
    denial of service or possibly for code execution.

  - CVE-2017-18203
    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in
    creation and deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices. A
    local user could potentially use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18216
    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to
    hold a necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file
    operations, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local user could use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18232
    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem, between probing and
    destroying a port. This could lead to a deadlock. A
    physically present attacker could use this to cause a
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18241
    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not
    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750
    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a
    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.
    A local user with access to files on a hugetlbfs
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause
    a denial of service or remote code execution in the
    client.

  - CVE-2018-1000004
    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This
    could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-1000199
    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did
    not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.
    Local users can use this to cause a denial of service,
    or possibly for privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and
    i386) and possibly other architectures.","Upgrade the linux packages.

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2015-9016
    Ming Lei reported a race condition in the multiqueue
    block layer (blk-mq). On a system with a driver using
    blk-mq (mtip32xx, null_blk, or virtio_blk), a local user
    might be able to use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2017-0861
    Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the
    ALSA (sound) PCM core. We believe this was not possible
    in practice.

  - CVE-2017-5715
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    various processors supporting speculative execution,
    enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process
    to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the
    system.

  This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch target
  injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64 and
  i386) by using the 'retpoline' compiler feature which allows
  indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

  - CVE-2017-5753
    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in
    various processors supporting speculative execution,
    enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process
    to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the
    system.

  This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1 (bounds-check
  bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable code sections
  (array bounds checking followed by array access) and replacing the
  array access with the speculation-safe array_index_nospec()
  function.

  More use sites will be added over time.

  - CVE-2017-13166
    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2
    ioctl handling code has been found. Memory protections
    ensuring user-provided buffers always point to userland
    memory were disabled, allowing destination addresses to
    be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a local user with
    access to a suitable video device can exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2017-13220
    Al Viro reported that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation
    could dereference a pointer before performing the
    necessary type check. A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16526
    Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may
    dereference an invalid pointer in an error case. A local
    user might be able to use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16911
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd
    driver exposed kernel heap addresses to local users.
    This information could aid the exploitation of other
    vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2017-16912
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to perform a range check on a received packet
    header field, leading to an out-of-bounds read. A remote
    user able to connect to the USB/IP server could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16913
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to perform a range check on a received packet
    header field, leading to excessive memory allocation. A
    remote user able to connect to the USB/IP server could
    use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-16914
    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver
    failed to check for an invalid combination of fields in
    a received packet, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A remote user able to connect to the USB/IP
    server could use this for denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18017
    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter
    xt_TCPMSS module failed to validate TCP header lengths,
    potentially leading to a use-after-free. If this module
    is loaded, it could be used by a remote attacker for
    denial of service or possibly for code execution.

  - CVE-2017-18203
    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in
    creation and deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices. A
    local user could potentially use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18216
    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to
    hold a necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file
    operations, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local user could use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2017-18232
    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem, between probing and
    destroying a port. This could lead to a deadlock. A
    physically present attacker could use this to cause a
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2017-18241
    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not
    properly initialise its state if the 'noflush_merge'
    mount option is used. A local user with access to a
    filesystem mounted with this option could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1066
    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client
    implementation would dereference a NULL pointer if the
    server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup
    negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-1068
    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility
    layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset
    values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to
    privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

  - CVE-2018-1092
    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image
    would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local
    user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this
    for denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-5332
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an
    out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with
    the rds module loaded could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5333
    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    properly handle an error case, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds
    module loaded could possibly use this for denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-5750
    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a
    kernel heap address. This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-5803
    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not
    range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local
    or remote user could use this to cause a denial of
    service.

  - CVE-2018-6927
    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on
    futexes did not check for negative parameter values,
    which might lead to a denial of service or other
    security impact.

  - CVE-2018-7492
    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was
    lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a
    system with the rds module loaded could use this for
    denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7566
    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl
    operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access
    or use-after-free. A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-7740
    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.
    A local user with access to files on a hugetlbfs
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.

  - CVE-2018-7757
    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS
    (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a
    system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service.

  - CVE-2018-7995
    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to
    have any security impact.

  - CVE-2018-8781
    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's
    mmap operation did not properly range-check the file
    offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer
    device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory,
    leading to privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-8822
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs
    client implementation did not validate reply lengths
    from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause
    a denial of service or remote code execution in the
    client.

  - CVE-2018-1000004
    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This
    could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-1000199
    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did
    not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.
    Local users can use this to cause a denial of service,
    or possibly for privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and
    i386) and possibly other architectures.","Upgrade the linux packages.

reference, the relevant part of the original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5715

Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running
on the system.

This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2
(branch target injection) and is mitigated for the x86
architecture (amd64 and i386) by using new microcoded
features.

This mitigation requires an update to the processor's
microcode, which is non-free. For recent Intel processors,
this is included in the intel-microcode package from version
3.20180425.1~deb8u1. For other processors, it may be
included in an update to the system BIOS or UEFI firmware,
or in a later update to the amd64-microcode package.

This vulnerability was already mitigated for the x86
architecture by the 'retpoline' feature.

CVE-2017-5753

Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
(bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2018-1066

Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
would dereference a NULL pointer if the server sent an invalid
response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation. This could be used by a
malicious server for denial of service.

The previously applied mitigation for this issue was not
appropriate for Linux 3.16 and has been replaced by an
alternate fix.

CVE-2018-1093

Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger an
out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A local
user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
service.

CVE-2018-1130

The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of sendmsg()
does not check the socket state, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
dereference. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash). 

CVE-2018-3665

Multiple researchers have discovered that some Intel x86 processors
can speculatively read floating-point and vector registers even when
access to those registers is disabled. The Linux kernel's 'lazy FPU'
feature relies on that access control to avoid saving and restoring
those registers for tasks that do not use them, and was enabled by
default on x86 processors that do not support the XSAVEOPT
instruction.

If 'lazy FPU' is enabled on one of the affected processors,
an attacker controlling an unprivileged process may be able
to read sensitive information from other users' processes or
the kernel. This specifically affects processors based on
the 'Nehalem' and 'Westemere' core designs. This issue has
been mitigated by disabling 'lazy FPU' by default on all x86
processors that support the FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions,
which includes all processors known to be affected and most
processors that perform speculative execution. It can also
be mitigated by adding the kernel parameter: eagerfpu=on

CVE-2018-5814

Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver. A
malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a USB/IP server.

CVE-2018-9422

It was reported that the futex() system call could be used by an
unprivileged user for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10853

Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttil&auml; reported that KVM for x86
processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when emulating
certain instructions. This could be used by an unprivileged user in a
guest VM to escalate their privileges within the guest.

CVE-2018-10940

Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does not
correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl. A
user with access to a cdrom device could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

CVE-2018-11506

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the SCSI
optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently large buffer
for sense data. A user with access to a SCSI optical disc device that
can produce more than 64 bytes of sense data could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption), and possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image could
trigger a denial of service (memory corruption). This could possibly
also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

The syzbot software found that the SCSI generic driver (sg) would in
some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised buffers,
which could include sensitive information from the kernel or other
tasks. However, only privileged users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN or
CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability were allowed to do this, so this has little
or no security impact.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.57-1. This update additionally fixes Debian bug #898165, and
includes many more bug fixes from stable update 3.16.57.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

(bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2018-1066

Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
would dereference a NULL pointer if the server sent an invalid
response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation. This could be used by a
malicious server for denial of service.

The previously applied mitigation for this issue was not
appropriate for Linux 3.16 and has been replaced by an
alternate fix.

CVE-2018-1093

Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger an
out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A local
user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
service.

CVE-2018-1130

The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of sendmsg()
does not check the socket state, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
dereference. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash). 

CVE-2018-3665

Multiple researchers have discovered that some Intel x86 processors
can speculatively read floating-point and vector registers even when
access to those registers is disabled. The Linux kernel's 'lazy FPU'
feature relies on that access control to avoid saving and restoring
those registers for tasks that do not use them, and was enabled by
default on x86 processors that do not support the XSAVEOPT
instruction.

If 'lazy FPU' is enabled on one of the affected processors,
an attacker controlling an unprivileged process may be able
to read sensitive information from other users' processes or
the kernel. This specifically affects processors based on
the 'Nehalem' and 'Westemere' core designs. This issue has
been mitigated by disabling 'lazy FPU' by default on all x86
processors that support the FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions,
which includes all processors known to be affected and most
processors that perform speculative execution. It can also
be mitigated by adding the kernel parameter: eagerfpu=on

CVE-2018-5814

Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver. A
malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a USB/IP server.

CVE-2018-9422

It was reported that the futex() system call could be used by an
unprivileged user for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10853

Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttil&auml; reported that KVM for x86
processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when emulating
certain instructions. This could be used by an unprivileged user in a
guest VM to escalate their privileges within the guest.

CVE-2018-10940

Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does not
correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl. A
user with access to a cdrom device could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

CVE-2018-11506

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the SCSI
optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently large buffer
for sense data. A user with access to a SCSI optical disc device that
can produce more than 64 bytes of sense data could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption), and possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image could
trigger a denial of service (memory corruption). This could possibly
also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

The syzbot software found that the SCSI generic driver (sg) would in
some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised buffers,
which could include sensitive information from the kernel or other
tasks. However, only privileged users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN or
CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability were allowed to do this, so this has little
or no security impact.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.57-1. This update additionally fixes Debian bug #898165, and
includes many more bug fixes from stable update 3.16.57.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

CVE-2017-5715

Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running

features.

This mitigation requires an update to the processor's
microcode, which is non-free. For recent Intel processors,
this is included in the intel-microcode package from version
3.20180425.1~deb8u1. For other processors, it may be
included in an update to the system BIOS or UEFI firmware,
or in a later update to the amd64-microcode package.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5715

Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running
on the system.

This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2
(branch target injection) and is mitigated for the x86
architecture (amd64 and i386) by using new microcoded
features.

This mitigation requires an update to the processor's
microcode, which is non-free. For recent Intel processors,
this is included in the intel-microcode package from version
3.20180425.1~deb8u1. For other processors, it may be
included in an update to the system BIOS or UEFI firmware,
or in a later update to the amd64-microcode package.

This vulnerability was already mitigated for the x86
architecture by the 'retpoline' feature.

CVE-2017-5753

Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
(bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2018-1066

Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
would dereference a NULL pointer if the server sent an invalid
response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation. This could be used by a
malicious server for denial of service.

The previously applied mitigation for this issue was not
appropriate for Linux 3.16 and has been replaced by an
alternate fix.

CVE-2018-1093

Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger an
out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A local
user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
service.

CVE-2018-1130

The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of sendmsg()
does not check the socket state, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
dereference. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash). 

CVE-2018-3665

Multiple researchers have discovered that some Intel x86 processors
can speculatively read floating-point and vector registers even when
access to those registers is disabled. The Linux kernel's 'lazy FPU'
feature relies on that access control to avoid saving and restoring
those registers for tasks that do not use them, and was enabled by
default on x86 processors that do not support the XSAVEOPT
instruction.

If 'lazy FPU' is enabled on one of the affected processors,
an attacker controlling an unprivileged process may be able
to read sensitive information from other users' processes or
the kernel. This specifically affects processors based on
the 'Nehalem' and 'Westemere' core designs. This issue has
been mitigated by disabling 'lazy FPU' by default on all x86
processors that support the FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions,
which includes all processors known to be affected and most
processors that perform speculative execution. It can also
be mitigated by adding the kernel parameter: eagerfpu=on

CVE-2018-5814

Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver. A
malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a USB/IP server.

CVE-2018-9422

It was reported that the futex() system call could be used by an
unprivileged user for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10853

Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttil&auml; reported that KVM for x86
processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when emulating
certain instructions. This could be used by an unprivileged user in a
guest VM to escalate their privileges within the guest.

CVE-2018-10940

Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does not
correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl. A
user with access to a cdrom device could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

CVE-2018-11506

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the SCSI
optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently large buffer
for sense data. A user with access to a SCSI optical disc device that
can produce more than 64 bytes of sense data could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption), and possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image could
trigger a denial of service (memory corruption). This could possibly
also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

The syzbot software found that the SCSI generic driver (sg) would in
some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised buffers,
which could include sensitive information from the kernel or other
tasks. However, only privileged users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN or
CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability were allowed to do this, so this has little
or no security impact.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.57-1. This update additionally fixes Debian bug #898165, and
includes many more bug fixes from stable update 3.16.57.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

It was reported that the futex() system call could be used by an
unprivileged user for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10853

Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttil&auml; reported that KVM for x86
processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when emulating
certain instructions. This could be used by an unprivileged user in a
guest VM to escalate their privileges within the guest.

CVE-2018-10940

Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does not
correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl. A
user with access to a cdrom device could use this to cause a denial of

CVE-2018-11506

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the SCSI
optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently large buffer
for sense data. A user with access to a SCSI optical disc device that
can produce more than 64 bytes of sense data could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption), and possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image could
trigger a denial of service (memory corruption). This could possibly
also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

The syzbot software found that the SCSI generic driver (sg) would in
some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised buffers,
which could include sensitive information from the kernel or other
tasks. However, only privileged users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN or
CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability were allowed to do this, so this has little
or no security impact.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.57-1. This update additionally fixes Debian bug #898165, and
includes many more bug fixes from stable update 3.16.57.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5715

Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running
on the system.

This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2
(branch target injection) and is mitigated for the x86
architecture (amd64 and i386) by using new microcoded
features.

This mitigation requires an update to the processor's
microcode, which is non-free. For recent Intel processors,
this is included in the intel-microcode package from version
3.20180425.1~deb8u1. For other processors, it may be
included in an update to the system BIOS or UEFI firmware,
or in a later update to the amd64-microcode package.

This vulnerability was already mitigated for the x86
architecture by the 'retpoline' feature.

CVE-2017-5753

Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
(bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2018-1066

Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
would dereference a NULL pointer if the server sent an invalid
response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation. This could be used by a
malicious server for denial of service.

The previously applied mitigation for this issue was not
appropriate for Linux 3.16 and has been replaced by an
alternate fix.

CVE-2018-1093

Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger an
out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A local
user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
service.

CVE-2018-1130

The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of sendmsg()
does not check the socket state, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
dereference. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash). 

CVE-2018-3665

Multiple researchers have discovered that some Intel x86 processors
can speculatively read floating-point and vector registers even when
access to those registers is disabled. The Linux kernel's 'lazy FPU'
feature relies on that access control to avoid saving and restoring
those registers for tasks that do not use them, and was enabled by
default on x86 processors that do not support the XSAVEOPT
instruction.

If 'lazy FPU' is enabled on one of the affected processors,
an attacker controlling an unprivileged process may be able
to read sensitive information from other users' processes or
the kernel. This specifically affects processors based on
the 'Nehalem' and 'Westemere' core designs. This issue has
been mitigated by disabling 'lazy FPU' by default on all x86
processors that support the FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions,
which includes all processors known to be affected and most
processors that perform speculative execution. It can also
be mitigated by adding the kernel parameter: eagerfpu=on

CVE-2018-5814

Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver. A
malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a USB/IP server.

log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX timer
implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the tmem
driver, local users could potentially read data from other users'
deleted files if they were able to create new files on the same
volume.

CVE-2018-16884

A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting NFS
shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could lead to a
user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this for denial of
service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable by
users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager that
can result in a process briefly having access to memory after it is
freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create containers
could possibly exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption)
or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some xattr
(extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk format of
the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use this for
denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly validate
the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with access to a
cdrom device could use this to read sensitive information from the
kernel or to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the USB
audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially

implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use
this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes. On a system with
CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the
initial net namespace could use this to cause a crash (oops) or other
hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

CVE-2019-7222

Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86. A local
user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read sensitive
information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack segments,
including those in other processes, to grow downward to address 0. On
systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this exacerbated other
vulnerabilities: a NULL pointer dereference could be exploited for
privilege escalation rather than only for denial of service.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

filesystem implementation introduced in DLA-1422-1. For reference the
original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a crash
(BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume could use this
for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
(bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's encrypted
key type. A local user could use this for denial of service or
possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
(SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to read
sensitive information from another context. In particular, code in a
software sandbox may be able to read sensitive information from
outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as Spectre variant 4.

This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
processors.

CVE-2018-5848

The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan and
connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow. On systems
using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
could use this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the system
log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX timer
implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the tmem
driver, local users could potentially read data from other users'
deleted files if they were able to create new files on the same
volume.

CVE-2018-16884

A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting NFS
shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could lead to a
user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this for denial of
service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable by
users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager that
can result in a process briefly having access to memory after it is
freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create containers
could possibly exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption)
or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some xattr
(extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk format of
the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use this for
denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly validate
the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with access to a
cdrom device could use this to read sensitive information from the
kernel or to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the USB
audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
designed USB device could use this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the USB
core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use
this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes. On a system with
CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the
initial net namespace could use this to cause a crash (oops) or other
hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs interface
exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access to these files
could use this for denial of service.

This interface is only accessible to root by default, which
fully mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user with
access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in KVM's
nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a local user
with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
issue.

CVE-2019-7222

Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86. A local
user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read sensitive
information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack segments,
including those in other processes, to grow downward to address 0. On
systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this exacerbated other
vulnerabilities: a NULL pointer dereference could be exploited for
privilege escalation rather than only for denial of service.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a crash
(BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume could use this
for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
(bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's encrypted
key type. A local user could use this for denial of service or
possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
(SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to read
sensitive information from another context. In particular, code in a
software sandbox may be able to read sensitive information from
outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as Spectre variant 4.

This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
processors.

CVE-2018-5848

The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan and
connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow. On systems
using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
could use this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the system
log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX timer
implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the tmem
driver, local users could potentially read data from other users'
deleted files if they were able to create new files on the same
volume.

CVE-2018-16884

A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting NFS
shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could lead to a
user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this for denial of
service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable by
users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager that
can result in a process briefly having access to memory after it is
freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create containers
could possibly exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption)
or for privilege escalation.

Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some xattr
(extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk format of
the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use this for

cdrom device could use this to read sensitive information from the
kernel or to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the USB
audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
designed USB device could use this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive

CVE-2018-20511

InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use
this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes. On a system with
CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the
initial net namespace could use this to cause a crash (oops) or other
hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs interface
exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access to these files
could use this for denial of service.

This interface is only accessible to root by default, which
fully mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user with
access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in KVM's
nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a local user
with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the

CVE-2019-7222

Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86. A local
user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read sensitive
information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack segments,
including those in other processes, to grow downward to address 0. On
systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this exacerbated other
vulnerabilities: a NULL pointer dereference could be exploited for
privilege escalation rather than only for denial of service.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in KVM's
nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a local user
with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the

CVE-2019-7222

Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86. A local
user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read sensitive
information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack segments,
including those in other processes, to grow downward to address 0. On
systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this exacerbated other
vulnerabilities: a NULL pointer dereference could be exploited for
privilege escalation rather than only for denial of service.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use
this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes. On a system with
CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the
initial net namespace could use this to cause a crash (oops) or other
hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs interface
exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access to these files
could use this for denial of service.

This interface is only accessible to root by default, which
fully mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user with
access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in KVM's
nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a local user
with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
issue.

CVE-2019-7222

Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86. A local
user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read sensitive
information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack segments,
including those in other processes, to grow downward to address 0. On
systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this exacerbated other
vulnerabilities: a NULL pointer dereference could be exploited for
privilege escalation rather than only for denial of service.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

could possibly exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption)
or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some xattr
(extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk format of
the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use this for
denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly validate
the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with access to a
cdrom device could use this to read sensitive information from the
kernel or to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the USB
audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
designed USB device could use this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the USB
core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use
this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes. On a system with
CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the
initial net namespace could use this to cause a crash (oops) or other
hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs interface
exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access to these files
could use this for denial of service.

This interface is only accessible to root by default, which
fully mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user with
access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in KVM's
nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a local user
with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
issue.

CVE-2019-7222

Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86. A local
user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read sensitive
information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack segments,
including those in other processes, to grow downward to address 0. On
systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this exacerbated other
vulnerabilities: a NULL pointer dereference could be exploited for
privilege escalation rather than only for denial of service.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

CVE-2018-5995

ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual
addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to
exploit other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127, CVE-2018-12130, CVE-2019-11091

Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way that
Intel processor designs implement speculative forwarding of data
filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). This
flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to
read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other
processes running on the system, or across guest/host boundaries to
read host memory.

See
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/m
ds.html for more details.

To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary
to install updated CPU microcode. An updated intel-microcode
package (only available in Debian non-free) was provided via
DLA-1789-1. The updated CPU microcode may also be available
as part of a system firmware ('BIOS') update.

CVE-2019-2024

A use-after-free bug was discovered in the em28xx video capture
driver. Local users might be able to use this for denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Karamba Security Ltd. research team
discovered missing range checks in the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation.
If Bluetooth is enabled, a nearby attacker could use these to read
sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3882

It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of
DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of a
vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory
condition).

CVE-2019-3901

Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition that would allow a local
user to read performance events from a task after it executes a setuid
program. This could leak sensitive information processed by setuid
programs. Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged
users to access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates
this issue.

CVE-2019-6133

Jann Horn of Google found that Policykit's authentication check could
be bypassed by a local user creating a process with the same start
time and process ID as an older authenticated process. PolicyKit was
already updated to fix this in DLA-1644-1. The kernel has additionally
been updated to avoid a delay between assigning start time and process
ID, which should make the attack impractical.

CVE-2019-9503

Hugues Anguelkov and others at Quarkslab discovered that the brcmfmac
(Broadcom wifi FullMAC) driver did not correctly distinguish messages
sent by the wifi firmware from other packets. An attacker using the
same wifi network could use this for denial of service or to exploit
other vulnerabilities in the driver.

CVE-2019-11190

Robert &#x15A;wi&#x119;cki reported that when a setuid program was
executed it was still possible to read performance events while the
kernel set up the program's address space. A local user could use this
to defeat ASLR in a setuid program, making it easier to exploit other
vulnerabilities in the program. Debian's kernel configuration does not
allow unprivileged users to access peformance events by default, which
fully mitigates this issue.

CVE-2019-11486

Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens
R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to cause
unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled.

CVE-2019-11599

Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user
could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.68-1. This version also includes a fix for Debian bug #927781,

CVE-2018-5995

ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual
addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to
exploit other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127, CVE-2018-12130, CVE-2019-11091

Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way that
Intel processor designs implement speculative forwarding of data
filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). This
flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to
read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other
processes running on the system, or across guest/host boundaries to
read host memory.

See
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/m
ds.html for more details.

To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary
to install updated CPU microcode. An updated intel-microcode
package (only available in Debian non-free) was provided via
DLA-1789-1. The updated CPU microcode may also be available
as part of a system firmware ('BIOS') update.

CVE-2019-2024

A use-after-free bug was discovered in the em28xx video capture
driver. Local users might be able to use this for denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Karamba Security Ltd. research team
discovered missing range checks in the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation.
If Bluetooth is enabled, a nearby attacker could use these to read
sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3882

It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of
DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of a
vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory
condition).

CVE-2019-3901

Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition that would allow a local
user to read performance events from a task after it executes a setuid
program. This could leak sensitive information processed by setuid
programs. Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged
users to access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates
this issue.

CVE-2019-6133

Jann Horn of Google found that Policykit's authentication check could
be bypassed by a local user creating a process with the same start
time and process ID as an older authenticated process. PolicyKit was
already updated to fix this in DLA-1644-1. The kernel has additionally
been updated to avoid a delay between assigning start time and process
ID, which should make the attack impractical.

CVE-2019-9503

Hugues Anguelkov and others at Quarkslab discovered that the brcmfmac
(Broadcom wifi FullMAC) driver did not correctly distinguish messages
sent by the wifi firmware from other packets. An attacker using the
same wifi network could use this for denial of service or to exploit
other vulnerabilities in the driver.

CVE-2019-11190

Robert &#x15A;wi&#x119;cki reported that when a setuid program was
executed it was still possible to read performance events while the
kernel set up the program's address space. A local user could use this
to defeat ASLR in a setuid program, making it easier to exploit other
vulnerabilities in the program. Debian's kernel configuration does not
allow unprivileged users to access peformance events by default, which
fully mitigates this issue.

CVE-2019-11486

Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens
R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to cause
unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled.

CVE-2019-11599

Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user
could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.68-1. This version also includes a fix for Debian bug #927781,

CVE-2018-5995

ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual
addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to
exploit other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127, CVE-2018-12130, CVE-2019-11091

Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way that
Intel processor designs implement speculative forwarding of data
filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). This
flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to
read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other
processes running on the system, or across guest/host boundaries to
read host memory.

See
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/m
ds.html for more details.

To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary
to install updated CPU microcode. An updated intel-microcode
package (only available in Debian non-free) was provided via
DLA-1789-1. The updated CPU microcode may also be available
as part of a system firmware ('BIOS') update.

CVE-2019-2024

A use-after-free bug was discovered in the em28xx video capture
driver. Local users might be able to use this for denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Karamba Security Ltd. research team
discovered missing range checks in the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation.
If Bluetooth is enabled, a nearby attacker could use these to read
sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3882

It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of
DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of a
vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory
condition).

CVE-2019-3901

Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition that would allow a local
user to read performance events from a task after it executes a setuid
program. This could leak sensitive information processed by setuid
programs. Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged
users to access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates
this issue.

CVE-2019-6133

Jann Horn of Google found that Policykit's authentication check could
be bypassed by a local user creating a process with the same start
time and process ID as an older authenticated process. PolicyKit was
already updated to fix this in DLA-1644-1. The kernel has additionally
been updated to avoid a delay between assigning start time and process
ID, which should make the attack impractical.

CVE-2019-9503

Hugues Anguelkov and others at Quarkslab discovered that the brcmfmac
(Broadcom wifi FullMAC) driver did not correctly distinguish messages
sent by the wifi firmware from other packets. An attacker using the
same wifi network could use this for denial of service or to exploit
other vulnerabilities in the driver.

CVE-2019-11190

Robert &#x15A;wi&#x119;cki reported that when a setuid program was
executed it was still possible to read performance events while the
kernel set up the program's address space. A local user could use this
to defeat ASLR in a setuid program, making it easier to exploit other
vulnerabilities in the program. Debian's kernel configuration does not
allow unprivileged users to access peformance events by default, which
fully mitigates this issue.

CVE-2019-11486

Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens
R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to cause
unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled.

CVE-2019-11599

Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user
could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.68-1. This version also includes a fix for Debian bug #927781,

CVE-2019-11478

Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource

CVE-2019-11479

Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel
to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of which
contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth
required to deliver the same amount of data.

This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the
minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default
uses the formerly hard- coded value of 48. We recommend
raising this to 512 unless you know that your network
requires a lower value. (This value applies to Linux 3.16

ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. A local user
with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain
sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.68-2. Packages for PC architectures (amd64 and i386) are already
available, and packages for Arm architectures (armel and armhf) will
be available soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126

huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi
(mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-5489

Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the same
memory-mapped file.

CVE-2019-11477

Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource
usage.

CVE-2019-11479

Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel
to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of which
contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth
required to deliver the same amount of data.

This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the
minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default
uses the formerly hard- coded value of 48. We recommend
raising this to 512 unless you know that your network
requires a lower value. (This value applies to Linux 3.16
only.)

CVE-2019-11810

It was discovered that the megaraid_sas driver did not correctly
handle a failed memory allocation during initialisation, which could
lead to a double-free. This might have some security impact, but it
cannot be triggered by an unprivileged user.

CVE-2019-11833

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. A local
user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem
image, for example using a removable drive, might be able to use this
to obtain sensitive information.

allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs
to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of
information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially
crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information
(e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host
than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed.
The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.9-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

CVE-2019-13272

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace subsystem in the Linux kernel
mishandles the management of the credentials of a process that wants
to create a ptrace relationship, allowing a local user to obtain root
privileges under certain scenarios.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version

corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20836

chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem
supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead to a
use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited.

CVE-2019-1125

It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a
conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel from user
mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped.
This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could allow local users
to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It
has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative
execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel
does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-3900

It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the
amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious
guest could use this to cause a denial of service (unbounded CPU
usage) on the host.

CVE-2019-10207

The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various
drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access
to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for
denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-10638

packet IDs used a weak hash function, 'jhash'. This could enable
tracking individual computers as they communicate with different
remote servers and from different networks. The 'siphash' function is
now used instead.

It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could
overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's
descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB
device could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops), or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14283

The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk
driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a disk
present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer,
possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy
disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could

mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped.
This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could allow local users
to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It
has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative
execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel
does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-3900

It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the
amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious
guest could use this to cause a denial of service (unbounded CPU
usage) on the host.

CVE-2019-10207

The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various
drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access
to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for
denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-10638

Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
packet IDs used a weak hash function, 'jhash'. This could enable
tracking individual computers as they communicate with different
remote servers and from different networks. The 'siphash' function is
now used instead.

CVE-2019-13631

It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could
overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's
descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB
device could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops), or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14283

The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk
driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a disk
present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer,
possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy
disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could
use this for denial of service (oops).

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets
implementation. A local user could use this for denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as
user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security
vulnerabilities.

XSA-300

Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory
which a domain will attempt to balloon out, nor limits the amount of
'foreign / grant map' memory which any individual guest can consume,
leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.72-1.

disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could
use this for denial of service (oops).

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets
implementation. A local user could use this for denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as
user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security
vulnerabilities.

XSA-300

Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory
which a domain will attempt to balloon out, nor limits the amount of
'foreign / grant map' memory which any individual guest can consume,
leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.72-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

CVE-2019-1547

Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this
is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases,
it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead
of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a
group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where
all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used
then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which
may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation.
In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability
to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit
parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application
using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable
because explicit parameters are never used.

execute speculatively, reading sensitive data from internal buffers
and leaking it through dependent operations. Intel calls this 'TSX
Asynchronous Abort' (TAA).

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation. A
local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can result
in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation. A
local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can result
in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service

could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to

which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service

properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can result
in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some

cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can result
in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting

cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to

properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media

release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation. A
local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can result
in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation. A
local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to

privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of

escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can result
in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target

successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
