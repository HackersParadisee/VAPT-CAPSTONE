  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.","Upgrade the linux packages.","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=988044

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.","Upgrade the linux packages.","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=988044

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.","Upgrade the linux packages.","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=988044

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.","Upgrade the linux packages.","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=988044

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.","Upgrade the linux packages.","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=988044

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

    to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing
    filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in
    crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write
    arbitrary files on the system. (CVE-2022-1271)

advisory.

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap
    buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other
    malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But
    there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the
    octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence
    of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote
    exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing
    modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,
    `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to
    directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module
    `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present
    on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be
    specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important
    modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

  - In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances
    where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection

    Debian Bug     : 989228 991492 1010295 1010254 1010253 1010252

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
    library. These flaws may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
    information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a
    denial of service attack.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    7.64.0-4+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

    For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
    its security tracker page at:

    CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2795 CVE-2022-38177 CVE-2022-38178

    Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server
    implementation.

    CVE-2022-2795

        Yehuda Afek, Anat Bremler-Barr and Shani Stajnrod discovered that a
        flaw in the resolver code can cause named to spend excessive amounts
        of time on processing large delegations, significantly degrade
        resolver performance and result in denial of service.

    CVE-2022-38177

        It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA
        algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker
        can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,
        resulting in a denial of service.

    CVE-2022-38178

        It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA
        algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker
        can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,
        resulting in a denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u8.

    We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

                     983479 989147 990542

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.


    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    Debian Bug     : 998626 1000262 1003712

    Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BlueZ, the Linux Bluetooth
    protocol stack. An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or
    leak information.

    CVE-2019-8921

        SDP infoleak, the vulnerability lies in the handling of a
        SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation of BlueZ. By crafting a
        malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into
        returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in
        leaking arbitrary heap data.

    CVE-2019-8922

        SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol
        handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge
        number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow
        the static buffer provided to hold the response.

    CVE-2021-41229

        sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in
        the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will
        cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large
        object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending
        sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to
        crash.

    CVE-2021-43400

        A use-after-free in gatt-database.c can occur when a client
        disconnects during D-Bus processing of a WriteValue call.

    CVE-2022-0204

        A heap overflow vulnerability was found in bluez. An attacker with
        local network access could pass specially crafted files causing an
        application to halt or crash, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2022-39176

        BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive
        information because profiles/audio/avrcp.c does not validate
        params_len.

    CVE-2022-39177

        BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of
        service because malformed and invalid capabilities can be
        processed in profiles/audio/avdtp.c.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

        disconnects during D-Bus processing of a WriteValue call.

    CVE-2022-0204

        A heap overflow vulnerability was found in bluez. An attacker with
        local network access could pass specially crafted files causing an
        application to halt or crash, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2022-39176

        BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive
        information because profiles/audio/avrcp.c does not validate
        params_len.

    CVE-2022-39177

        BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of
        service because malformed and invalid capabilities can be
        processed in profiles/audio/avdtp.c.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    5.50-1.2~deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your bluez packages.

    Debian Bug     : 998626 1000262 1003712

    Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BlueZ, the Linux Bluetooth
    protocol stack. An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or
    leak information.

    CVE-2019-8921

        SDP infoleak, the vulnerability lies in the handling of a
        SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation of BlueZ. By crafting a
        malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into
        returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in
        leaking arbitrary heap data.

    CVE-2019-8922

        SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol
        handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge
        number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow
        the static buffer provided to hold the response.

    CVE-2021-41229

        sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in
        the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will
        cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large
        object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending
        sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to
        crash.

    CVE-2021-43400

        A use-after-free in gatt-database.c can occur when a client
        disconnects during D-Bus processing of a WriteValue call.

        number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow
        the static buffer provided to hold the response.

    CVE-2021-41229

        sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in
        the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will
        cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large
        object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending
        sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to
        crash.

    CVE-2021-43400

        A use-after-free in gatt-database.c can occur when a client
        disconnects during D-Bus processing of a WriteValue call.

    CVE-2022-0204

        A heap overflow vulnerability was found in bluez. An attacker with
        local network access could pass specially crafted files causing an
        application to halt or crash, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2022-39176

        BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive
        information because profiles/audio/avrcp.c does not validate
        params_len.

    CVE-2022-39177

        BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of
        service because malformed and invalid capabilities can be
        processed in profiles/audio/avdtp.c.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    5.50-1.2~deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your bluez packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1022224 1022225

    It was discovered that libxml2, the GNOME XML library, was vulnerable to
    integer overflows and memory corruption.

    CVE-2022-40303

         Parsing a XML document with the XML_PARSE_HUGE option enabled can result
         in an integer overflow because safety checks were missing in some
         functions. Also, the xmlParseEntityValue function did not have any length
         limitation.

    CVE-2022-40304

         When a reference cycle is detected in the XML entity cleanup function the
         XML entity data can be stored in a dictionary. In this case, the
         dictionary becomes corrupted resulting in logic errors, including memory
         errors like double free.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2601 CVE-2022-3775

    Several issues were found in GRUB2's font handling code, which could
    result in crashes and potentially execution of arbitrary code. These
    could lead to by-pass of UEFI Secure Boot on affected systems.

    Further, issues were found in image loading that could potentially
    lead to memory overflows.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.06-3~deb10u2.

    We recommend that you upgrade your grub2 packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2022-42898
    Debian Bug     : 1024267

    It was discovered that there was a potential Denial of Service (DoS)
    attack against krb5, a suite of tools implementing the Kerberos
    authentication system. An integer overflow in PAC parsing could have
    been exploited if a cross-realm entity acted maliciously.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    1.17-3+deb10u5.

    We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.

                     CVE-2022-31629 CVE-2022-37454

    Multiple security issues were discovered in PHP, a widely-used open
    source general purpose scripting language which could result in denial
    of service, information disclosure, insecure cooking handling or
    potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    7.3.31-1~deb10u2.

    We recommend that you upgrade your php7.3 packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1011160 1014494 1022555 1024737

    Multiple vulnerabilities were found in tiff, a library and tools
    providing support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), leading to
    denial of service (DoS) and possibly local code execution.

    CVE-2022-1354

        A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffinfo.c in
        TIFFReadRawDataStriped() function. This flaw allows an attacker to
        pass a crafted TIFF file to the tiffinfo tool, triggering a heap
        buffer overflow issue and causing a crash that leads to a denial
        of service.

    CVE-2022-1355

        A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffcp.c in
        main() function. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a crafted
        TIFF file to the tiffcp tool, triggering a stack buffer overflow
        issue, possibly corrupting the memory, and causing a crash that
        leads to a denial of service.

    CVE-2022-2056, CVE-2022-2057, CVE-2022-2058

        Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop allows attackers to cause a
        denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.

    CVE-2022-2867, CVE-2022-2868, CVE-2022-2869

        libtiff's tiffcrop utility has underflow and input validation flaw
        that can lead to out of bounds read and write. An attacker who
        supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop (likely via tricking a user to
        run tiffcrop on it with certain parameters) could cause a crash or
        in some cases, further exploitation.

    CVE-2022-3570, CVE-2022-3598

        Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff
        allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access
        via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application
        crash, potential information disclosure or any other
        context-dependent impact.

    CVE-2022-3597, CVE-2022-3626, CVE-2022-3627

        Out-of-bounds write, allowing attackers to cause a
        denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.

    CVE-2022-3599

        Out-of-bounds read in writeSingleSection in tools/tiffcrop.c,
        allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff
        file.

    CVE-2022-3970

        Affects the function TIFFReadRGBATileExt of the file
        libtiff/tif_getimage.c. The manipulation leads to integer
        overflow.

    CVE-2022-34526

        A stack overflow was discovered in the _TIFFVGetField function of
        Tiffsplit. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial
        of Service (DoS) via a crafted TIFF file parsed by the tiffsplit
        or tiffcrop utilities.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    4.1.0+git191117-2~deb10u5.

    We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1011160 1014494 1022555 1024737

    Multiple vulnerabilities were found in tiff, a library and tools
    providing support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), leading to
    denial of service (DoS) and possibly local code execution.

    CVE-2022-1354

        A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffinfo.c in
        TIFFReadRawDataStriped() function. This flaw allows an attacker to
        pass a crafted TIFF file to the tiffinfo tool, triggering a heap
        buffer overflow issue and causing a crash that leads to a denial
        of service.

    CVE-2022-1355

        A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffcp.c in
        main() function. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a crafted
        TIFF file to the tiffcp tool, triggering a stack buffer overflow
        issue, possibly corrupting the memory, and causing a crash that
        leads to a denial of service.

    CVE-2022-2056, CVE-2022-2057, CVE-2022-2058

        Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop allows attackers to cause a
        denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.

    CVE-2022-2867, CVE-2022-2868, CVE-2022-2869

        libtiff's tiffcrop utility has underflow and input validation flaw
        that can lead to out of bounds read and write. An attacker who
        supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop (likely via tricking a user to
        run tiffcrop on it with certain parameters) could cause a crash or
        in some cases, further exploitation.

    CVE-2022-3570, CVE-2022-3598

        Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff
        allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access
        via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application
        crash, potential information disclosure or any other
        context-dependent impact.

    CVE-2022-3597, CVE-2022-3626, CVE-2022-3627

        Out-of-bounds write, allowing attackers to cause a
        denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.

    CVE-2022-3599

        Out-of-bounds read in writeSingleSection in tools/tiffcrop.c,
        allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff
        file.

    CVE-2022-3970

        Affects the function TIFFReadRGBATileExt of the file
        libtiff/tif_getimage.c. The manipulation leads to integer
        overflow.

    CVE-2022-34526

        A stack overflow was discovered in the _TIFFVGetField function of
        Tiffsplit. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial
        of Service (DoS) via a crafted TIFF file parsed by the tiffsplit
        or tiffcrop utilities.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    4.1.0+git191117-2~deb10u5.

    We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

        libtiff's tiffcrop utility has underflow and input validation flaw
        that can lead to out of bounds read and write. An attacker who
        supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop (likely via tricking a user to
        run tiffcrop on it with certain parameters) could cause a crash or
        in some cases, further exploitation.

    CVE-2022-3570, CVE-2022-3598

        Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff
        allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access
        via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application
        crash, potential information disclosure or any other
        context-dependent impact.

    CVE-2022-3597, CVE-2022-3626, CVE-2022-3627

        Out-of-bounds write, allowing attackers to cause a
        denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.

    CVE-2022-3599

        Out-of-bounds read in writeSingleSection in tools/tiffcrop.c,
        allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff
        file.

    CVE-2022-3970

        Affects the function TIFFReadRGBATileExt of the file
        libtiff/tif_getimage.c. The manipulation leads to integer
        overflow.

    CVE-2022-34526

        A stack overflow was discovered in the _TIFFVGetField function of
        Tiffsplit. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial
        of Service (DoS) via a crafted TIFF file parsed by the tiffsplit
        or tiffcrop utilities.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

    Debian Bug     : 1011160 1014494 1022555 1024737

    Multiple vulnerabilities were found in tiff, a library and tools
    providing support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), leading to
    denial of service (DoS) and possibly local code execution.

    CVE-2022-1354

        A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffinfo.c in
        TIFFReadRawDataStriped() function. This flaw allows an attacker to
        pass a crafted TIFF file to the tiffinfo tool, triggering a heap
        buffer overflow issue and causing a crash that leads to a denial
        of service.

    CVE-2022-1355

        A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffcp.c in
        main() function. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a crafted
        TIFF file to the tiffcp tool, triggering a stack buffer overflow
        issue, possibly corrupting the memory, and causing a crash that
        leads to a denial of service.

    CVE-2022-2056, CVE-2022-2057, CVE-2022-2058

        Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop allows attackers to cause a
        denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.

    CVE-2022-2867, CVE-2022-2868, CVE-2022-2869

        libtiff's tiffcrop utility has underflow and input validation flaw
        that can lead to out of bounds read and write. An attacker who
        supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop (likely via tricking a user to
        run tiffcrop on it with certain parameters) could cause a crash or
        in some cases, further exploitation.

    CVE-2022-3570, CVE-2022-3598

        Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff
        allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access
        via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application
        crash, potential information disclosure or any other
        context-dependent impact.

    CVE-2022-3597, CVE-2022-3626, CVE-2022-3627

        Out-of-bounds write, allowing attackers to cause a
        denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.

    CVE-2022-3599

        Out-of-bounds read in writeSingleSection in tools/tiffcrop.c,
        allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff
        file.

    CVE-2022-3970

        Affects the function TIFFReadRGBATileExt of the file
        libtiff/tif_getimage.c. The manipulation leads to integer
        overflow.

    CVE-2022-34526

        A stack overflow was discovered in the _TIFFVGetField function of
        Tiffsplit. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial
        of Service (DoS) via a crafted TIFF file parsed by the tiffsplit
        or tiffcrop utilities.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    4.1.0+git191117-2~deb10u5.

    We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1031632

    Several flaws were found in tiffcrop, a program distributed by tiff, a library
    and tools providing support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF).
    A specially crafted tiff file can lead to an out-of-bounds write or read
    resulting in a denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    4.1.0+git191117-2~deb10u7.

    We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2022-31631 CVE-2023-0567 CVE-2023-0568 CVE-2023-0662
    Debian Bug     : 1031368

    Multiple security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source
    general purpose scripting language, which could result in denial of
    service or incorrect validation of BCrypt hashes.

    CVE-2022-31631

        Due to an uncaught integer overflow, `PDO::quote()` of PDO_SQLite
        may return an improperly quoted string.  The exact details likely
        depend on the implementation of `sqlite3_snprintf()`, but with some
        versions it is possible to force the function to return a single
        apostrophe, if the function is called on user supplied input without

    Debian Bug     : 1031368

    Multiple security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source
    general purpose scripting language, which could result in denial of
    service or incorrect validation of BCrypt hashes.

    CVE-2022-31631

        Due to an uncaught integer overflow, `PDO::quote()` of PDO_SQLite
        may return an improperly quoted string.  The exact details likely
        depend on the implementation of `sqlite3_snprintf()`, but with some
        versions it is possible to force the function to return a single
        apostrophe, if the function is called on user supplied input without
        any length restrictions in place.

    CVE-2023-0567

        Tim Dsterhus discovered that malformed BCrypt hashes that include a
        `$` within their salt part trigger a buffer overread and may
        erroneously validate any password as valid.  (`Password_verify()`

                     CVE-2022-37436

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache HTTP
    server.

    CVE-2006-20001

    A carefully crafted If: request header can cause a memory read, or write
    of a single zero byte, in a pool (heap) memory location beyond the header
    value sent. This could cause the process to crash.

    CVE-2021-33193

    A crafted method sent through HTTP/2 will bypass validation and be
    forwarded by mod_proxy, which can lead to request splitting or cache
    poisoning.

    CVE-2022-36760

    Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')
    vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to
    smuggle requests to the AJP server it forwards requests to.

    CVE-2022-37436

    A malicious backend can cause the response headers to be truncated early,
    resulting in some headers being incorporated into the response body. If
    the later headers have any security purpose, they will not be interpreted
    by the client.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.4.38-3+deb10u9.

    We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1011954

    Multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities were found in pcre2, a Perl
    Compatible Regular Expression library, which could result in information
    disclosure or denial or service.

    CVE-2019-20454

        Out-of-bounds read when the pattern \X is JIT compiled and used to
        match specially crafted subjects in non-UTF mode.

    CVE-2022-1586

        Out-of-bounds read involving unicode property matching in
        JIT-compiled regular expressions. The issue occurs because the
        character was not fully read in case-less matching within JIT.

    CVE-2022-1587

        Out-of-bounds read affecting recursions in JIT-compiled regular
        expressions caused by duplicate data transfers.

    This upload also fixes a subject buffer overread in JIT when UTF is
    disabled and \X or \R has a greater than 1 fixed quantifier. This issue
    was found by Yunho Kim.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-27533 CVE-2023-27535 CVE-2023-27536 CVE-2023-27538

    Several security vulnerabilities have been found in cURL, an easy-to-use
    client-side URL transfer library.

    CVE-2023-27533

        A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl during
        communication using the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on
        maliciously crafted user name and telnet options during server
        negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send
        content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent.
        This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input,
        thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.

    CVE-2023-27535

        An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the FTP
        connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used
        during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in a
        connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain
        FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,
        CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the
        configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could
        lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer,
        potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

    CVE-2023-27536

        An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the
        connection reuse feature which can reuse previously established connections
        with incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for changes in
        the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability affects
        krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and could potentially result in
        unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option is to not
        reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed.

    CVE-2023-27538

        An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl where it
        reuses a previously established SSH connection despite the fact that an SSH
        option was modified, which should have prevented reuse. libcurl maintains a
        pool of previously used connections to reuse them for subsequent transfers
        if the configurations match. However, two SSH settings were omitted from
        the configuration check, allowing them to match easily, potentially leading
        to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    7.64.0-4+deb10u6.

    We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

    Package        : apache2
    Version        : 2.4.38-3+deb10u10
    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-25690 CVE-2023-27522
    Debian Bug     : 1032476

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in apache2,
    a webserver that may be used as front-end proxy for other applications.
    These vulnerabilities may lead to HTTP request smuggling, and thus
    to front-end security controls being bypassed.

    Unfortunately, fixing these security vulnerabilities may require
    changes to configuration files. Some out-of-specification
    RewriteRule directives that were previously silently accepted,
    are now rejected with error AH10409. For instance, some RewriteRules
    that included a back-reference and the flags [L,NC] will need to
    be written with extra escaping flags such as [B= ?,BNP,QSA].

    CVE-2023-25690

      Some mod_proxy configurations allow an HTTP request Smuggling
      attack. Configurations are affected when mod_proxy is
      enabled along with some form of RewriteRule
      or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches
      some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL)
      data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target
      using variable substitution.

    CVE-2023-27522

        HTTP Response Smuggling in mod_proxy_uwsgi

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.4.38-3+deb10u10.

    We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

                     CVE-2022-45061
    Debian Bug     : 970099

    Multiple security issues were discovered in Python, an interactive
    high-level object-oriented language. An attacker may cause command
    injection, denial of service (DoS), request smuggling and port
    scanning.

    CVE-2015-20107

        The mailcap module does not add escape characters into commands
        discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to
        inject shell commands into applications that call
        mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of
        user-provided filenames or arguments).

    CVE-2019-20907

        In Lib/tarfile.py, an attacker is able to craft a TAR archive
        leading to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open, because
        _proc_pax lacks header validation.

    CVE-2020-8492

        Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
        of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
        urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

    CVE-2020-26116

        http.client allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the
        HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF
        control characters in the first argument of
        HTTPConnection.request.

    CVE-2021-3177

        Python has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c,
        which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python
        applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted
        input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to
        c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.

    CVE-2021-3733

        There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An
        attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client
        (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular
        Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication
        request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the
        server to the client.

    CVE-2021-3737

        An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of
        python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server,
        to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU
        time.

    CVE-2021-4189

        The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV (passive)
        mode trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw
        allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick
        FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and
        port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning
        ports. For the rare user who wants the previous behavior, set a
        `trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address` attribute on your `ftplib.FTP`
        instance to True.

    CVE-2022-45061

        An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when
        processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a

    Debian Bug     : 970099

    Multiple security issues were discovered in Python, an interactive
    high-level object-oriented language. An attacker may cause command
    injection, denial of service (DoS), request smuggling and port
    scanning.

    CVE-2015-20107

        The mailcap module does not add escape characters into commands
        discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to
        inject shell commands into applications that call
        mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of
        user-provided filenames or arguments).

    CVE-2019-20907

        In Lib/tarfile.py, an attacker is able to craft a TAR archive
        leading to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open, because
        _proc_pax lacks header validation.

    CVE-2020-8492

        Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
        of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
        urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

    CVE-2020-26116

        http.client allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the
        HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF
        control characters in the first argument of
        HTTPConnection.request.

    CVE-2021-3177

        Python has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c,
        which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python
        applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted
        input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to
        c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.

    CVE-2021-3733

        There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An
        attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client
        (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular
        Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication
        request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the
        server to the client.

    CVE-2021-3737

        An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of
        python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server,
        to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU
        time.

    CVE-2021-4189

        The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV (passive)
        mode trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw
        allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick
        FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and
        port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning
        ports. For the rare user who wants the previous behavior, set a
        `trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address` attribute on your `ftplib.FTP`
        instance to True.

    CVE-2022-45061

        An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when
        processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a
        crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder
        could lead to a CPU denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.7.16-2+deb10u2.

        discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to
        inject shell commands into applications that call
        mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of
        user-provided filenames or arguments).

    CVE-2019-20907

        In Lib/tarfile.py, an attacker is able to craft a TAR archive
        leading to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open, because
        _proc_pax lacks header validation.

    CVE-2020-8492

        Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
        of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
        urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

    CVE-2020-26116

        http.client allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the
        HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF
        control characters in the first argument of
        HTTPConnection.request.

    CVE-2021-3177

        Python has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c,
        which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python
        applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted
        input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to
        c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.

    CVE-2021-3733

        There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An
        attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client
        (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular
        Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication
        request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the
        server to the client.

    CVE-2021-3737

        An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of
        python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server,
        to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU
        time.

    CVE-2021-4189

        The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV (passive)
        mode trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw
        allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick
        FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and
        port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning
        ports. For the rare user who wants the previous behavior, set a
        `trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address` attribute on your `ftplib.FTP`
        instance to True.

    CVE-2022-45061

        An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when
        processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a
        crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder
        could lead to a CPU denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.7.16-2+deb10u2.

                     CVE-2022-45061
    Debian Bug     : 970099

    Multiple security issues were discovered in Python, an interactive
    high-level object-oriented language. An attacker may cause command
    injection, denial of service (DoS), request smuggling and port
    scanning.

    CVE-2015-20107

        The mailcap module does not add escape characters into commands
        discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to
        inject shell commands into applications that call
        mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of
        user-provided filenames or arguments).

    CVE-2019-20907

        In Lib/tarfile.py, an attacker is able to craft a TAR archive
        leading to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open, because
        _proc_pax lacks header validation.

    CVE-2020-8492

        Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
        of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
        urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

    CVE-2020-26116

        http.client allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the
        HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF
        control characters in the first argument of
        HTTPConnection.request.

    CVE-2021-3177

        Python has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c,
        which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python
        applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted
        input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to
        c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.

    CVE-2021-3733

        There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An
        attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client
        (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular
        Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication
        request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the
        server to the client.

    CVE-2021-3737

        An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of
        python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server,
        to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU
        time.

    CVE-2021-4189

        The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV (passive)
        mode trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw
        allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick
        FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and
        port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning
        ports. For the rare user who wants the previous behavior, set a
        `trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address` attribute on your `ftplib.FTP`
        instance to True.

    CVE-2022-45061

        An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when
        processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a
        crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder
        could lead to a CPU denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.7.16-2+deb10u2.

    We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1034720

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
    Sockets Layer toolkit.

    CVE-2023-0464

        David Benjamin reported a flaw related to the verification of
        X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints, which
        may result in denial of service.

    CVE-2023-0465

        David Benjamin reported that invalid certificate policies in leaf
        certificates are silently ignored. A malicious CA could take
        advantage of this flaw to deliberately assert invalid certificate
        policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate
        altogether.

    CVE-2023-0466

        David Benjamin discovered that the implementation of the
        X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function does not enable the check
        which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to
        pass the certificate verification (contrary to its documentation).

    CVE-2023-2650

        It was discovered that processing malformed ASN.1 object
        identifiers or data may result in denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

        altogether.

    CVE-2023-0466

        David Benjamin discovered that the implementation of the
        X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function does not enable the check
        which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to
        pass the certificate verification (contrary to its documentation).

    CVE-2023-2650

        It was discovered that processing malformed ASN.1 object
        identifiers or data may result in denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1.1.1n-0+deb10u5.

    Version        : 2.21.0-1+deb10u1
    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-32681
    Debian Bug     : 1036693

    Requests, a Python HTTP library, has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers
    to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. For HTTP
    connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the
    request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server.
    However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in
    the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.
    This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination
    server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate
    sensitive information.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    2.21.0-1+deb10u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your requests packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-3247

    Niels Dossche and Tim Dsterhus discovered that PHP's implementation of
    the SOAP HTTP Digest authentication did not check for failures, which
    may result in a stack information leak.  Furthermore, the code used an
    insufficient number of random bytes.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    7.3.31-1~deb10u4.

    We recommend that you upgrade your php7.3 packages.

    Package        : libxpm
    Version        : 1:3.5.12-1+deb10u1
    CVE ID         : CVE-2022-4883 CVE-2022-44617 CVE-2022-46285

    libxpm is a library handling X PixMap image format (so called xpm files).
    xpm files are an extension of the monochrome X BitMap format specified
    in the X protocol, and is commonly used in traditional X applications.

    CVE-2022-4883

        When processing files with
        .Z or .gz extensions, the library calls external programs
        to compress and uncompress files, relying on the
        PATH environment variable to find these programs,
        which could allow a malicious user to execute other programs
        by manipulating the PATH environment variable.

    CVE-2022-44617

        When processing a file with width of 0
        and a very large height, some parser functions will be
        called repeatedly and can lead to an infinite loop,
        resulting in a Denial of Service in the application linked
        to the library.

    CVE-2022-46285

        When parsing a file with a comment
        not closed, an end-of-file condition will not be detected,
        leading to an infinite loop and resulting in a
        Denial of Service in the application linked to the library.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:3.5.12-1+deb10u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your libxpm packages.

    Package        : openssh
    Version        : 1:7.9p1-10+deb10u3
    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-38408
    Debian Bug     : 1042460

    It was discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled loading certain
    PKCS#11 providers. If a user forwarded their ssh-agent to an untrusted
    system, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to load
    arbitrary libraries from the users system and execute arbitrary code.

    In addition to the above security issue, this update also fixed
    another bug - bad interaction between the ssh_config ConnectTimeout

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-3823 CVE-2023-3824

    Security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source general
    purpose scripting language, which could result in information
    disclosure, denial of service or potentially remote code execution.

    CVE-2023-3823

         Various XML functions rely on libxml global state to track
         configuration variables, like whether external entities are loaded.
         This state is assumed to be unchanged unless the user explicitly
         changes it by calling appropriate function.  Joas Schilling and
         Baptista Katapi discovered that, since the state is process-global,
         other modules  such as ImageMagick  may also use this library
         within the same process and change that global state for their
         internal purposes, and leave it in a state where external entities
         loading is enabled.  This can lead to the situation where external
         XML is parsed with external entities loaded, which can lead to
         disclosure of any local files accessible to PHP.  This vulnerable
         state may persist in the same process across many requests, until
         the process is shut down.

    CVE-2023-3824

        Niels Dossche discovered that when loading a Phar file, while
        reading PHAR directory entries, insufficient length checking may
        lead to a stack buffer overflow, leading potentially to memory
        corruption or RCE.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    7.3.31-1~deb10u5.

    Debian Bug     : 932329 943562

    Vulnerabilities were found in libssh2, a client-side C library
    implementing the SSH2 protocol, which could lead to denial of service or
    remote information disclosure.

    CVE-2019-13115

        Kevin Backhouse discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in kex.c's
        kex_method_diffie_hellman_group_exchange_sha256_key_exchange()
        function, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way
        packets are read from the server.  A remote attacker who compromises
        an SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause
        a denial of service condition on the client system when a user
        connects to the server.

    CVE-2019-17498

        Kevin Backhouse discovered that the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in
        packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, thereby enabling
        an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a
        subsequent memory read.  A malicious SSH server may be able to
        disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service
        condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.

    CVE-2020-22218

        An issue was discovered in function _libssh2_packet_add(), which
        could allow attackers to access out of bounds memory.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1.8.0-2.1+deb10u1.

    This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities concerning the urlparse module as
    well as vulnerabilities concerning the heapq, hmac, plistlib and ssl modules.

    CVE-2021-23336

        Python was vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urlparse.parse_qsl and
        urlparse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the
        attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
        cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy
        (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in
        malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would
        usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not
        include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

    CVE-2022-0391

        The urlparse module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into
        components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize
        input and allows characters like '\r' and '\n' in the URL path.  This flaw
        allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks.

    CVE-2022-48560

        A use-after-free exists in Python via heappushpop in heapq.

    CVE-2022-48565

        An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python.  The plistlib
        module no longer accepts entity declarations in XML plist files to avoid
        XML vulnerabilities.

    CVE-2022-48566

        An issue was discovered in compare_digest in Lib/hmac.py in Python.
        Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the accumulator
        variable in hmac.compare_digest.

    CVE-2023-24329

        An issue in the urlparse component of Python allows attackers to bypass
        blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.

    CVE-2023-40217

        The issue primarily affects servers written in Python (such as HTTP
        servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is
        created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly,
        there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket
        as not connected and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will
        still be readable from the socket buffer.  This data will not be
        authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate
        authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data
        is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS
        connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the
        vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on
        initialization of the SSLSocket.)


    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.7.16-2+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

    This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities concerning the urlparse module as
    well as vulnerabilities concerning the heapq, hmac, plistlib and ssl modules.

    CVE-2021-23336

        Python was vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urlparse.parse_qsl and
        urlparse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the
        attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
        cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy
        (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in
        malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would
        usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not
        include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

    CVE-2022-0391

        The urlparse module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into
        components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize
        input and allows characters like '\r' and '\n' in the URL path.  This flaw
        allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks.

    CVE-2022-48560

        A use-after-free exists in Python via heappushpop in heapq.

    CVE-2022-48565

        An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python.  The plistlib
        module no longer accepts entity declarations in XML plist files to avoid
        XML vulnerabilities.

    CVE-2022-48566

        An issue was discovered in compare_digest in Lib/hmac.py in Python.
        Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the accumulator
        variable in hmac.compare_digest.

    CVE-2023-24329

        An issue in the urlparse component of Python allows attackers to bypass
        blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.

    CVE-2023-40217

        The issue primarily affects servers written in Python (such as HTTP
        servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is
        created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly,
        there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket
        as not connected and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will
        still be readable from the socket buffer.  This data will not be
        authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate
        authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data
        is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS
        connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the
        vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on

        Yair Mizrahi found an infinite recursion in PutSubImage when
        parsing a crafted file, which would result in stack exhaustion
        and denial of service.

    CVE-2023-43787

        Yair Mizrahi discovered an integer overflow in XCreateImage
        when parsing crafted input, which would result in a small buffer
        allocation leading into a buffer overflow. This could result
        in denial of service or potentially in arbitrary code execution.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2019-11236 CVE-2019-11324 CVE-2020-26137 CVE-2023-43804
    Debian Bug     : 927172 927412 1053626

    Security vulnerabilities were found in python-urllib3, an HTTP library
    with thread-safe connection pooling for Python, which could lead to
    information disclosure or authorization bypass.

    CVE-2019-11236

        Hanno Bck discovered that an attacker controlling the request
        parameter can inject headers by injecting CR/LF chars.  The issue is
        similar to CPython's CVE-2019-9740.

    CVE-2019-11324

        Christian Heimes discovered that when verifying HTTPS connections
        upon passing an SSLContext to urllib3, system CA certificates are
        loaded into the SSLContext by default in addition to any
        manually-specified CA certificates.
        This causes TLS handshakes that should fail given only the manually
        specified certs to succeed based on system CA certs.

    CVE-2020-26137

        It was discovered that CRLF injection was possible if the attacker
        controls the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR
        and LF control characters in the first argument of putrequest().
        The issue is similar to urllib's CVE-2020-26116.

    CVE-2023-43804

        It was discovered that the Cookie request header isn't stripped
        during cross-origin redirects.  It is therefore possible for a user
        specifying a Cookie header to unknowingly leak information via HTTP
        redirects to a different origin (unless the user disables redirects
        explicitly).  The issue is similar to CVE-2018-20060, but for Cookie
        request header rather than Authorization.

        Moreover authorization request headers were not removed
        redirecting to cross-site.  Per RFC7230 sec. 3.2 header fields are
        to be treated case-insensitively.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1.24.1-1+deb10u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your python-urllib3 packages.

    Debian Bug     : 927172 927412 1053626

    Security vulnerabilities were found in python-urllib3, an HTTP library
    with thread-safe connection pooling for Python, which could lead to
    information disclosure or authorization bypass.

    CVE-2019-11236

        Hanno Bck discovered that an attacker controlling the request
        parameter can inject headers by injecting CR/LF chars.  The issue is
        similar to CPython's CVE-2019-9740.

    CVE-2019-11324

        Christian Heimes discovered that when verifying HTTPS connections
        upon passing an SSLContext to urllib3, system CA certificates are
        loaded into the SSLContext by default in addition to any
        manually-specified CA certificates.
        This causes TLS handshakes that should fail given only the manually
        specified certs to succeed based on system CA certs.

    CVE-2020-26137

        It was discovered that CRLF injection was possible if the attacker
        controls the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR
        and LF control characters in the first argument of putrequest().
        The issue is similar to urllib's CVE-2020-26116.

    CVE-2023-43804

        It was discovered that the Cookie request header isn't stripped
        during cross-origin redirects.  It is therefore possible for a user
        specifying a Cookie header to unknowingly leak information via HTTP
        redirects to a different origin (unless the user disables redirects
        explicitly).  The issue is similar to CVE-2018-20060, but for Cookie
        request header rather than Authorization.

        Moreover authorization request headers were not removed
        redirecting to cross-site.  Per RFC7230 sec. 3.2 header fields are
        to be treated case-insensitively.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1.24.1-1+deb10u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your python-urllib3 packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2019-11236 CVE-2019-11324 CVE-2020-26137 CVE-2023-43804
    Debian Bug     : 927172 927412 1053626

    Security vulnerabilities were found in python-urllib3, an HTTP library
    with thread-safe connection pooling for Python, which could lead to
    information disclosure or authorization bypass.

    CVE-2019-11236

        Hanno Bck discovered that an attacker controlling the request
        parameter can inject headers by injecting CR/LF chars.  The issue is
        similar to CPython's CVE-2019-9740.

    CVE-2019-11324

        Christian Heimes discovered that when verifying HTTPS connections
        upon passing an SSLContext to urllib3, system CA certificates are
        loaded into the SSLContext by default in addition to any
        manually-specified CA certificates.
        This causes TLS handshakes that should fail given only the manually
        specified certs to succeed based on system CA certs.

    CVE-2020-26137

        It was discovered that CRLF injection was possible if the attacker
        controls the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR
        and LF control characters in the first argument of putrequest().
        The issue is similar to urllib's CVE-2020-26116.

    CVE-2023-43804

        It was discovered that the Cookie request header isn't stripped
        during cross-origin redirects.  It is therefore possible for a user
        specifying a Cookie header to unknowingly leak information via HTTP
        redirects to a different origin (unless the user disables redirects
        explicitly).  The issue is similar to CVE-2018-20060, but for Cookie
        request header rather than Authorization.

        Moreover authorization request headers were not removed
        redirecting to cross-site.  Per RFC7230 sec. 3.2 header fields are
        to be treated case-insensitively.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1.24.1-1+deb10u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your python-urllib3 packages.

                     CVE-2023-40217

    Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Python 3.7.

    CVE-2022-48560

        A use-after-free problem was found in the heappushpop function in
        the heapq module.

    CVE-2022-48564

        A potential denial-of-service vulnerability was discovered in the
        read_ints function used when processing certain malformed Apple
        Property List files in binary format.

    CVE-2022-48565

        An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered.  In order to
        avoid possible vulnerabilities, the plistlib module no longer
        accepts entity declarations in XML plist files.

    CVE-2022-48566

        Possible constant-time-defeating compiler optimisations were
        discovered in the accumulator variable in hmac.compare_digest.

    CVE-2023-40217

        It was discovered that it might be possible to bypass some of the
        protections implemented by the TLS handshake in the ssl.SSLSocket
        class.  For example, unauthenticated data might be read by a program
        expecting data authenticated by client certificates.

    Package        : ncurses
    Version        : 6.1+20181013-2+deb10u5
    CVE ID         : CVE-2021-39537 CVE-2023-29491
    Debian Bug     : 1034372

    Issues were found in ncurses, a collection of shared libraries for
    terminal handling, which could lead to denial of service.

    CVE-2021-39537

        It has been discovered that the tic(1) utility is susceptible to a
        heap overflow on crafted input due to improper bounds checking.

    CVE-2023-29491

        Jonathan Bar Or, Michael Pearse and Emanuele Cozzi have discovered
        that when ncurses is used by a setuid application, a local user can
        trigger security-relevant memory corruption via malformed data in a
        terminfo database file found in $HOME/.terminfo or reached via the
        TERMINFO or TERM environment variables.

        In order to mitigate this issue, ncurses now further restricts
        programs running with elevated privileges (setuid/setgid programs).
        Programs run by the superuser remain able to load custom terminfo
        entries.

        This change aligns ncurses' behavior in buster-security with that of
        Debian Bullseye's latest point release (6.2+20201114-2+deb11u2).

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

    Package        : php-phpseclib
    Version        : 2.0.30-2~deb10u2
    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-48795

    It was discovered that php-phpseclib, a PHP library for
    arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, was vulnerable to the so-called
    Terrapin Attack.

    The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, allows
    remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are
    omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and
    server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security
    features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack.  This
    occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by
    these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of
    sequence numbers.  For example, there is an effective attack against
    SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    2.0.30-2~deb10u2.

    We recommend that you upgrade your php-phpseclib packages.

    Successful attacks of this vulnerability can
    result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang
    or frequently repeatable crash.

    The main risk was a complete DOS of the sever.

    CVE ID         :
    Debian Bug     : 926450 948238 1061870

    man-db provides the man command used for reading manual pages.

    man-db 2.7.6.1-3 added AppArmor confinement for filter programs called
    by man, and man-db 2.8.0 added a seccomp sandbox to confine subprocesses
    that handle untrusted data.  These hardening measures caused various
    problems that have been fixed in more recent releases: the AppArmor
    confinement broke the ability to save compressed cat pages under
    /var/cache/man/, while the seccomp sandbox broke Hardened Malloc as well
    as systems using mksh-derived shells.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.8.5-2+deb10u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your man-db packages.

    For the detailed security status of man-db please refer to

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-52160
    Debian Bug     : 1064061

    It was discovered that there was a potential authentication bypass
    vulnerability in wpa, a set of tools including the widely-used
    wpasupplicant client for authenticating with WPA and WPA2 wireless
    networks.

    For an attack to have been successful, wpasupplicant must have been
    configured to not verify the network's TLS certificate during Phase 1
    of the authentication cycle; a eap_peap_decrypt vulnerability could
    have been used to skip Phase 2 authentication by sending an EAP-TLV
    Success packet instead of starting Phase 2.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    2:2.7+git20190128+0c1e29f-6+deb10u4.

    We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.

    Security issues were discovered in php-phpseclib, a PHP library for
    arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, which could lead to Denial of
    Service.

    CVE-2024-27354

        An attacker can construct a malformed certificate containing an
        extremely large prime to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption
        for an `isPrime` primality check).

        This issue was introduced when attempting to fix CVE-2023-27560.

    CVE-2024-27355

        When processing the ASN.1 object identifier of a certificate, a sub
        identifier may be provided that leads to a denial of service (CPU
        consumption for `decodeOID`).

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.0.30-2~deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your php-phpseclib packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-3576 CVE-2023-52356

    Two vulnerabilities were discovered in tiff, Tag Image File Format
    library.

    CVE-2023-3576

        A memory leak flaw was found in Libtiff's tiffcrop utility. This
        issue occurs when tiffcrop operates on a TIFF image file, allowing
        an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF image file to tiffcrop utility,
        which causes this memory leak issue, resulting an application
        crash, eventually leading to a denial of service

    CVE-2023-52356

        A segment fault (SEGV) flaw was found in libtiff that could be
        triggered by passing a crafted tiff file to the
        TIFFReadRGBATileExt() API. This flaw allows a remote attacker to
        cause a heap-buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    4.1.0+git191117-2~deb10u9.

    We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-27534

    curl was affected by a path traversal vulnerability.
    SFTP implementation causes the tilde (~) character to be wrongly
    replaced when used as a prefix in the first path element,
    in addition to its intended use as the first element to indicate
    a path relative to the user's home directory. Attackers can exploit
    this flaw to bypass filtering or execute arbitrary code by
    crafting a path like /~2/foo while accessing a server with
    a specific user.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    7.64.0-4+deb10u9.

    We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

        Skyler Ferrante discovered that the wall(1) utility found in
        util-linux, a collection of system utilities for Linux, does not
        filter escape sequences from command line arguments.  This allows
        unprivileged local users to put arbitrary text on other users
        terminals if mesg is set to y and the wall executable is setgid,

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-52425
    Debian Bug     : 1063238

    Expat, an XML parsing C library has been found to have an vulnerability
    that allows an attacker to perform a denial of service (resource
    consumption, when many full reparsings are required in the case of a
    large tokens.

    When parsing a really big token that requires multiple buffer fills to
    complete, expat has to re-parse the token from start multiple times,
    which takes time. These patches introduce a heuristic that, when having
    failed on the same token multiple times, defers further parsing until
    there's significantly more data available.

    The patch also introduces an optiional API,
    XML_SetReparseDeferralEnabled(), to disable the new heuristic.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    2.2.6-2+deb10u7.

    We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.

    Package        : nghttp2
    Version        : 1.36.0-2+deb10u3
    CVE ID         : CVE-2024-28182
    Debian Bug     : 1068415

    Bartek Nowotarskis discovered that nghttp2, a set of programs
    implementing the HTTP/2, keeps reading CONTINUATION frames even after a
    stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync.  This causes excessive
    CPU usage to decode HPACK stream, which could lead to Denial of Service.

    The issue is mitigated by limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames it
    can accept after a HEADERS frame.  The limit is configurable and
    defaults to 8.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    1.36.0-2+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your nghttp2 packages.

    For the detailed security status of nghttp2 please refer to
    its security tracker page at:

    Package        : distro-info-data
    Version        : 0.41+deb10u9

    This is a routine update of the distro-info-data database for Debian LTS
    users.

    It adds Ubuntu 24.10.

    Also included are LTS and ELTS columns for Debian, and ESM columns for
    Ubuntu. The version of distro-info in buster is not able to display the
    data from these columns, but they are present in the CSV.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    0.41+deb10u9.

    We recommend that you upgrade your distro-info-data packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2024-2756 CVE-2024-3096

    Security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source general
    purpose scripting language, which could result in information disclosure
    or incorrect validation of password hashes.

    CVE-2024-2756

        Marco Squarcina discovered that network and same-site attackers can
        set a standard insecure cookie in the victim's browser which is
        treated as a `__Host-` or `__Secure-` cookie by PHP applications.

        This issue stems from an incomplete fix to CVE-2022-31629.

    CVE-2024-3096

        Eric Stern discovered that if a password stored with password_hash()
        starts with a null byte (\x00), testing a blank string as the
        password via password_verify() incorrectly returns true.

        If a user were able to create a password with a leading null byte
        (unlikely, but syntactically valid), the issue would allow an
        attacker to trivially compromise the victim's account by attempting
        to sign in with a blank string.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

    Package        : python-idna
    Version        : 2.6-1+deb10u1
    CVE ID         : CVE-2024-3651
    Debian Bug     : 1069127

    Guido Vranken discovered an issue in python3-idna, a library to support
    the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) protocol.  A
    specially crafted argument to the idna.encode() function could consume
    significant resources, which may lead to Denial of Service.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    2.6-1+deb10u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your python-idna packages.

    For the detailed security status of python-idna please refer to
    its security tracker page at:
    https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-idna

    Version        : 2.58.3-2+deb10u6
    CVE ID         : CVE-2024-34397

    Alicia Boya Garcia reported that the GDBus signal subscriptions in the
    GLib library are prone to a spoofing vulnerability. A local attacker can
    take advantage of this flaw to cause a GDBus-based client to behave
    incorrectly, with an application-dependent impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    2.58.3-2+deb10u6.

    We recommend that you upgrade your glib2.0 packages.

    Debian Bug     :

    Two vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server implementation, which
    may result in denial of service.

    CVE-2023-50387

        Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol allow remote attackers to cause
        a denial of service via DNSSEC queries. This is known as the KeyTrap
        issue.

    CVE-2023-50868

        The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol allows remote
        attackers to cause a denial of service via DNSSEC queries in a random
        subdomain attack. This is known as the NSEC3 issue.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u11.

    Debian Bug     : 1068412

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Apache HTTP server,
    which may result in HTTP response splitting, denial of service, or
    authorization bypass.

    CVE-2019-17567

         mod_proxy_wstunnel configured on an URL that is not
         necessarily Upgraded by the origin server was tunneling
         the whole connection regardless, thus allowing for subsequent requests
         on the same connection to pass through with no HTTP validation,
         authentication or authorization possibly configured.

    CVE-2023-31122

        An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability was found in mod_macro.

    CVE-2023-38709

        A faulty input validation was found in the core of Apache
        that allows malicious or exploitable backend/content generators
        to split HTTP responses.

    CVE-2023-45802

        When an HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a
        time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed
        immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close.
        A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection
        busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing.
        On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process
        might run out of memory before that.

    CVE-2024-24795

        HTTP Response splitting in multiple modules in Apache HTTP Server
        allows an attacker that can inject malicious response headers into
        backend applications to cause an HTTP desynchronization attack.

    CVE-2024-27316

        HTTP/2 incoming headers exceeding the limit are temporarily
        buffered in nghttp2 in order to generate an informative HTTP
        413 response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this
        leads to memory exhaustion.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.4.59-1~deb10u1.

    Please note that the fix of CVE-2024-24795, may break unrelated
    CGI-BIN scripts. As part of the security fix, the Apache webserver
    mod_cgi module has stopped relaying the Content-Length field
    of the HTTP reply header from the CGI programs back to the client
    in cases where the connection is to be closed and the client
    is able to read until end-of-file. You may restore legacy
    behavior for trusted scripts by adding the following configuration
    environment variable to the
    Apache configuration, scoped to the <Directory> entry or
    entries in which scripts are being served via CGI,
    SetEnv ap_trust_cgilike_cl yes.
    The definitive fix is to read the whole input,
    re-allocating the input buffer to fit as more input is received
    in CGI-BIN scripts, and and to not trust that
    CONTENT_LENGTH variable is always present.

    We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

    mod_cgi module has stopped relaying the Content-Length field
    of the HTTP reply header from the CGI programs back to the client
    in cases where the connection is to be closed and the client
    is able to read until end-of-file. You may restore legacy
    behavior for trusted scripts by adding the following configuration
    environment variable to the
    Apache configuration, scoped to the <Directory> entry or
    entries in which scripts are being served via CGI,
    SetEnv ap_trust_cgilike_cl yes.
    The definitive fix is to read the whole input,
    re-allocating the input buffer to fit as more input is received
    in CGI-BIN scripts, and and to not trust that
    CONTENT_LENGTH variable is always present.

    Debian Bug     : 1068412

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Apache HTTP server,
    which may result in HTTP response splitting, denial of service, or
    authorization bypass.

    CVE-2019-17567

         mod_proxy_wstunnel configured on an URL that is not
         necessarily Upgraded by the origin server was tunneling
         the whole connection regardless, thus allowing for subsequent requests
         on the same connection to pass through with no HTTP validation,
         authentication or authorization possibly configured.

    CVE-2023-31122

        An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability was found in mod_macro.

    CVE-2023-38709

        A faulty input validation was found in the core of Apache
        that allows malicious or exploitable backend/content generators
        to split HTTP responses.

    CVE-2023-45802

        When an HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a
        time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed
        immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close.
        A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection
        busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing.
        On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process
        might run out of memory before that.

    CVE-2024-24795

        HTTP Response splitting in multiple modules in Apache HTTP Server
        allows an attacker that can inject malicious response headers into
        backend applications to cause an HTTP desynchronization attack.

    CVE-2024-27316

        HTTP/2 incoming headers exceeding the limit are temporarily
        buffered in nghttp2 in order to generate an informative HTTP
        413 response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this
        leads to memory exhaustion.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.4.59-1~deb10u1.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2024-5458
    Debian Bug     : 1072885

    PHP, a widely-used open source general purpose scripting language, is affected
    by a security problem when parsing certain types of URLs.

    Due to a code logic error filtering functions such as filter_var when
    validating URLs (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) will result in invalid user information
    (username + password part of URLs) being treated as valid user information.
    This may lead to the downstream code accepting invalid URLs as valid and
    parsing them incorrectly. The problem is related to CVE-2020-7071 but affects
    IPv6 host parts.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    7.3.31-1~deb10u7.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2021-41617 CVE-2023-48795 CVE-2023-51385
    Debian Bug     : 995130

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSH, an implementation of
    the SSH protocol suite.

    CVE-2021-41617

        It was discovered that sshd failed to correctly initialise supplemental
        groups when executing an AuthorizedKeysCommand or
        AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand, where a AuthorizedKeysCommandUser or
        AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser directive has been set to run the command
        as a different user. Instead these commands would inherit the groups that
        sshd was started with.

    CVE-2023-48795

        Fabian Baeumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Joerg Schwenk discovered that the SSH
        protocol is prone to a prefix truncation attack, known as the Terrapin
        attack. This attack allows a MITM attacker to effect a limited break of the
        integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra
        messages prior to the commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal
        number of consecutive messages immediately after encryption starts.

        Details can be found at https://terrapin-attack.com/

    CVE-2023-51385

        It was discovered that if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell
        metacharacters was passed to ssh, and a ProxyCommand, LocalCommand
        directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via
        expansion tokens, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary
        user/hostnames to ssh could potentially perform command injection. The
        situation could arise in case of git repositories with submodules, where the
        repository could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user or
        hostname.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:7.9p1-10+deb10u4.

    We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.
