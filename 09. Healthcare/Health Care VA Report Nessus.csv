The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:
  PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, HEAD

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,

following vulnerabilities :

  - An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in httpd
    due to third-party modules using the
    ap_get_basic_auth_pw() function outside of the
    authentication phase. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this to bypass authentication
    requirements. (CVE-2017-3167)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in httpd due to
    a NULL pointer dereference flaw that is triggered when a
    third-party module calls the mod_ssl
    ap_hook_process_connection() function during an HTTP
    request to an HTTPS port. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service
    condition. (CVE-2017-3169)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in httpd due to
    an out-of-bounds read error in the ap_find_token()
    function that is triggered when handling a specially
    crafted request header sequence. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to crash the
    service or force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect
    value. (CVE-2017-7668)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in httpd due to
    an out-of-bounds read error in the mod_mime that is

    response header. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this to disclose sensitive information or cause
    a denial of service condition. (CVE-2017-7679)

    a failure to initialize or reset the value placeholder
    in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' before
    or between successive key=value assignments by
    mod_auth_digest. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
