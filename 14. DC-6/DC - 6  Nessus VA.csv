    Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and
    missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi
    driver (brcmfmac), which a attacker on the same wifi
    network could use to cause denial of service or the

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted
    sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs)
    allows a remotely triggerable kernel panic.

  - CVE-2019-11478
    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted

    the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple
    TCP segments, each of which contains only 8 bytes of
    data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to
    deliver the same amount of data.

  - CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503
    Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and
    missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi
    driver (brcmfmac), which a attacker on the same wifi
    network could use to cause denial of service or the
    execution of arbitrary code.

  - CVE-2019-11477
    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted
    sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs)
    allows a remotely triggerable kernel panic.

  - CVE-2019-11478
    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted
    sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will
    fragment the TCP retransmission queue, allowing an
    attacker to cause excessive resource usage.

  - CVE-2019-11479
    Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force
    the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple
    TCP segments, each of which contains only 8 bytes of
    data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to
    deliver the same amount of data.

  This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
  (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard
  coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know
  that your network requires a lower value.

  - CVE-2019-11486
    Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in
    the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could
    use these to cause unspecified security impact. This
    module has therefore been disabled.

  - CVE-2019-11599
    Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the
    core dump implementation which could lead to a
    use-after-free. A local user could use this to read
    sensitive information, to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-11815
    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable
    Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of
    service and potentially privilege escalation. This
    protocol module (rds) is not auto loaded on Debian
    systems, so this issue only affects systems where it is
    explicitly loaded.

  - CVE-2019-11833
    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem
    implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel
    memory to new extent blocks. A local user able to write
    to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem
    image, for example using a removable drive, might be
    able to use this to obtain sensitive information.

  - CVE-2019-11884
    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation
    did not ensure that new connection names were
    null-terminated. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126
    huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the
    Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could
    use to cause denial of service or the execution of
    arbitrary code.

  - CVE-2019-5489
    Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael
    Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex
    Ionescu, and Anders Fogh discovered that local users
    could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive
    information from other processes that access the same
    memory-mapped file.

  - CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503
    Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and
    missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi
    driver (brcmfmac), which a attacker on the same wifi
    network could use to cause denial of service or the
    execution of arbitrary code.

  - CVE-2019-11477
    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted
    sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs)
    allows a remotely triggerable kernel panic.

  - CVE-2019-11478
    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted
    sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will
    fragment the TCP retransmission queue, allowing an
    attacker to cause excessive resource usage.

  - CVE-2019-11479
    Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force
    the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple
    TCP segments, each of which contains only 8 bytes of
    data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to
    deliver the same amount of data.

  This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
  (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard
  coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know
  that your network requires a lower value.

  - CVE-2019-11486
    Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in
    the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could
    use these to cause unspecified security impact. This
    module has therefore been disabled.

  - CVE-2019-11599
    Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the
    core dump implementation which could lead to a
    use-after-free. A local user could use this to read
    sensitive information, to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-11815
    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable
    Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of
    service and potentially privilege escalation. This
    protocol module (rds) is not auto loaded on Debian
    systems, so this issue only affects systems where it is
    explicitly loaded.

  - CVE-2019-11833
    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem
    implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel
    memory to new extent blocks. A local user able to write
    to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem
    image, for example using a removable drive, might be
    able to use this to obtain sensitive information.

  - CVE-2019-11884
    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation
    did not ensure that new connection names were
    null-terminated. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive

    Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not
    completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is
    passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to
    access its memory and I/O regions before enabling
    decoding of those regions. This could result in a
    denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host.

  The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5.

    Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the
    IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5995

    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the
    kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
    devices, which could lead to a use-after-free. It is not
    clear how this might be exploited.

  - CVE-2018-20856
    Xiao Jin reported a potential double-free in the block
    subsystem, in case an error occurs while initialising
    the I/O scheduler for a block device. It is not clear
    how this might be exploited.

  - CVE-2019-1125
    It was discovered that most x86 processors could
    speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used
    when entering the kernel from user mode, and/or could
    speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This
    is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could allow
    local users to obtain sensitive information from the
    kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by
    using memory barriers to limit speculative execution.
    Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the
    kernel does not use SWAPGS.

  - CVE-2019-3882
    It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit
    the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local
    user granted ownership of a vfio device could use this
    to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition).

  - CVE-2019-3900
    It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly
    control the amount of work done to service requests from
    guest VMs. A malicious guest could use this to cause a
    denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host.

  - CVE-2019-10207
    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in
    various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A
    local user with access to a pty device or other suitable
    tty device could use this for denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops).

  - CVE-2019-10638
    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function,
    'jhash'. This could enable tracking individual computers
    as they communicate with different remote servers and
    from different networks. The 'siphash' function is now
    used instead.

  - CVE-2019-10639
    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function
    that incorporated a kernel virtual address. This hash
    function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is
    still used for other purposes in the network stack.

  - CVE-2019-13631
    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input
    tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data
    while parsing the device's descriptor. A physically
    present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-13648
    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el)
    systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel
    would still attempt to restore TM state passed to the
    sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for
    denial-of-service (oops).

  - CVE-2019-14283
    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the
    floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy
    disk device, with a disk present, could use this to read
    kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining
    sensitive information.

  - CVE-2019-14284
    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in
    the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a
    floppy disk device could use this for denial-of-service
    (oops).

  - CVE-2019-15239
    Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in
    the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use
    this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - (CVE ID not yet assigned)

    The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses
    as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to
    exploit other security vulnerabilities.

  - XSA-300

    Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the
    amount of memory which a domain will attempt to balloon
    out, nor limits the amount of 'foreign / grant map'
    memory which any individual guest can consume, leading
    to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5.

    that incorporated a kernel virtual address. This hash
    function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is
    still used for other purposes in the network stack.

  - CVE-2019-13631
    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input
    tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data
    while parsing the device's descriptor. A physically
    present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-13648
    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el)
    systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel
    would still attempt to restore TM state passed to the
    sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for
    denial-of-service (oops).

  - CVE-2019-14283
    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the
    floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy
    disk device, with a disk present, could use this to read
    kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining
    sensitive information.

  - CVE-2019-14284
    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in
    the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a
    floppy disk device could use this for denial-of-service
    (oops).

  - CVE-2019-15239
    Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in
    the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use
    this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - (CVE ID not yet assigned)

    The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses
    as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to
    exploit other security vulnerabilities.

  - XSA-300

    Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the
    amount of memory which a domain will attempt to balloon
    out, nor limits the amount of 'foreign / grant map'
    memory which any individual guest can consume, leading
    to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).","Upgrade the linux packages.

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2015-8553
    Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not
    completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is
    passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to
    access its memory and I/O regions before enabling
    decoding of those regions. This could result in a
    denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host.

  The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5.

  - CVE-2017-18509
    Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the
    IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5995
    ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the
    virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could
    make it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-20836
    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the
    kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
    devices, which could lead to a use-after-free. It is not
    clear how this might be exploited.

  - CVE-2018-20856
    Xiao Jin reported a potential double-free in the block
    subsystem, in case an error occurs while initialising
    the I/O scheduler for a block device. It is not clear
    how this might be exploited.

  - CVE-2019-1125
    It was discovered that most x86 processors could
    speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used
    when entering the kernel from user mode, and/or could
    speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This
    is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could allow
    local users to obtain sensitive information from the
    kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by
    using memory barriers to limit speculative execution.
    Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the
    kernel does not use SWAPGS.

  - CVE-2019-3882
    It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit
    the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local
    user granted ownership of a vfio device could use this
    to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition).

  - CVE-2019-3900
    It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly
    control the amount of work done to service requests from
    guest VMs. A malicious guest could use this to cause a
    denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host.

  - CVE-2019-10207
    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in
    various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A
    local user with access to a pty device or other suitable
    tty device could use this for denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops).

  - CVE-2019-10638
    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function,
    'jhash'. This could enable tracking individual computers
    as they communicate with different remote servers and
    from different networks. The 'siphash' function is now

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2015-8553
    Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not
    completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is
    passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to
    access its memory and I/O regions before enabling
    decoding of those regions. This could result in a
    denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host.

  The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5.

  - CVE-2017-18509
    Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the
    IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5995
    ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the
    virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could
    make it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-20836
    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the
    kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
    devices, which could lead to a use-after-free. It is not
    clear how this might be exploited.

  - CVE-2018-20856
    Xiao Jin reported a potential double-free in the block
    subsystem, in case an error occurs while initialising
    the I/O scheduler for a block device. It is not clear
    how this might be exploited.

  - CVE-2019-1125
    It was discovered that most x86 processors could
    speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used
    when entering the kernel from user mode, and/or could
    speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This
    is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could allow
    local users to obtain sensitive information from the
    kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by
    using memory barriers to limit speculative execution.
    Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the
    kernel does not use SWAPGS.

  - CVE-2019-3882
    It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit
    the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local
    user granted ownership of a vfio device could use this
    to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition).

  - CVE-2019-3900
    It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly
    control the amount of work done to service requests from
    guest VMs. A malicious guest could use this to cause a
    denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host.

  - CVE-2019-10207
    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in
    various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A
    local user with access to a pty device or other suitable
    tty device could use this for denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops).

  - CVE-2019-10638
    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function,
    'jhash'. This could enable tracking individual computers
    as they communicate with different remote servers and
    from different networks. The 'siphash' function is now
    used instead.

  - CVE-2019-10639
    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function
    that incorporated a kernel virtual address. This hash
    function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is
    still used for other purposes in the network stack.

  - CVE-2019-13631
    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input
    tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data
    while parsing the device's descriptor. A physically
    present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-13648
    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el)
    systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel
    would still attempt to restore TM state passed to the
    sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for
    denial-of-service (oops).

  - CVE-2019-14283
    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the
    floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy
    disk device, with a disk present, could use this to read
    kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining
    sensitive information.

  - CVE-2019-14284
    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in
    the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a
    floppy disk device could use this for denial-of-service
    (oops).

  - CVE-2019-15239
    Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in
    the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use
    this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - (CVE ID not yet assigned)

    The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses
    as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to
    exploit other security vulnerabilities.

  - XSA-300

    Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the
    amount of memory which a domain will attempt to balloon
    out, nor limits the amount of 'foreign / grant map'
    memory which any individual guest can consume, leading
    to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).","Upgrade the linux packages.

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2015-8553
    Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not
    completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is
    passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to
    access its memory and I/O regions before enabling
    decoding of those regions. This could result in a
    denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host.

  The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5.

  - CVE-2017-18509
    Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the
    IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2018-5995
    ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the
    virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could
    make it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2018-20836
    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the
    kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
    devices, which could lead to a use-after-free. It is not
    clear how this might be exploited.

  - CVE-2018-20856
    Xiao Jin reported a potential double-free in the block
    subsystem, in case an error occurs while initialising
    the I/O scheduler for a block device. It is not clear
    how this might be exploited.

  - CVE-2019-1125
    It was discovered that most x86 processors could
    speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used
    when entering the kernel from user mode, and/or could
    speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This
    is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could allow
    local users to obtain sensitive information from the
    kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by
    using memory barriers to limit speculative execution.
    Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the
    kernel does not use SWAPGS.

  - CVE-2019-3882
    It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit
    the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local
    user granted ownership of a vfio device could use this
    to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition).

  - CVE-2019-3900
    It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly
    control the amount of work done to service requests from
    guest VMs. A malicious guest could use this to cause a
    denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host.

  - CVE-2019-10207
    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in
    various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A
    local user with access to a pty device or other suitable
    tty device could use this for denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops).

  - CVE-2019-10638
    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function,
    'jhash'. This could enable tracking individual computers
    as they communicate with different remote servers and
    from different networks. The 'siphash' function is now
    used instead.

  - CVE-2019-10639
    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function
    that incorporated a kernel virtual address. This hash
    function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is
    still used for other purposes in the network stack.

  - CVE-2019-13631
    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input
    tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data
    while parsing the device's descriptor. A physically
    present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-13648
    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el)
    systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel
    would still attempt to restore TM state passed to the
    sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for
    denial-of-service (oops).

  - CVE-2019-14283
    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the
    floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy
    disk device, with a disk present, could use this to read
    kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining
    sensitive information.

  - CVE-2019-14284
    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in
    the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a
    floppy disk device could use this for denial-of-service
    (oops).

  - CVE-2019-15239
    Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in
    the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use
    this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - (CVE ID not yet assigned)

    The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses
    as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to
    exploit other security vulnerabilities.

  - XSA-300

    Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the
    amount of memory which a domain will attempt to balloon
    out, nor limits the amount of 'foreign / grant map'
    memory which any individual guest can consume, leading
    to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems were mostly fixed

  - CVE-2019-3882
    It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit
    the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local
    user granted ownership of a vfio device could use this
    to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition).

  - CVE-2019-3900
    It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly
    control the amount of work done to service requests from
    guest VMs. A malicious guest could use this to cause a
    denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host.

  - CVE-2019-10207
    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in
    various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A
    local user with access to a pty device or other suitable
    tty device could use this for denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops).

  - CVE-2019-10638
    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function,
    'jhash'. This could enable tracking individual computers
    as they communicate with different remote servers and
    from different networks. The 'siphash' function is now
    used instead.

  - CVE-2019-10639
    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function
    that incorporated a kernel virtual address. This hash
    function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is
    still used for other purposes in the network stack.

  - CVE-2019-13631
    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input
    tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data
    while parsing the device's descriptor. A physically
    present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-13648
    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el)
    systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel
    would still attempt to restore TM state passed to the
    sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for
    denial-of-service (oops).

  - CVE-2019-14283
    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the
    floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy
    disk device, with a disk present, could use this to read
    kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining
    sensitive information.

  - CVE-2019-14284
    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in
    the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a
    floppy disk device could use this for denial-of-service
    (oops).

  - CVE-2019-15239
    Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in
    the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use
    this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - (CVE ID not yet assigned)

    The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses
    as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to
    exploit other security vulnerabilities.

  - XSA-300

    Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the
    amount of memory which a domain will attempt to balloon
    out, nor limits the amount of 'foreign / grant map'
    memory which any individual guest can consume, leading
    to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).","Upgrade the linux packages.

  - CVE-2015-8553
    Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not
    completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is
    passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to
    access its memory and I/O regions before enabling
    decoding of those regions. This could result in a
    denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host.

  The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5.

  - CVE-2017-18509
    Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the
    IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could
    use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or

  - CVE-2018-20836
    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the
    kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
    devices, which could lead to a use-after-free. It is not
    clear how this might be exploited.

  - CVE-2018-20856
    Xiao Jin reported a potential double-free in the block
    subsystem, in case an error occurs while initialising
    the I/O scheduler for a block device. It is not clear
    how this might be exploited.

  - CVE-2019-1125
    It was discovered that most x86 processors could
    speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used
    when entering the kernel from user mode, and/or could
    speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This
    is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could allow

  - CVE-2019-14821
    Matt Delco reported a race condition in KVM's coalesced
    MMIO facility, which could lead to out-of-bounds access
    in the kernel. A local attacker permitted to access
    /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2019-14835
    Peter Pi of Tencent Blade Team discovered a missing
    bounds check in vhost_net, the network back-end driver
    for KVM hosts, leading to a buffer overflow when the
    host begins live migration of a VM. An attacker in
    control of a VM could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation on the host.

  - CVE-2019-15117
    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported a missing bounds
    check in the usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code,
    leading to a buffer over-read. An attacker able to add

  - CVE-2018-12207
    It was discovered that on Intel CPUs supporting hardware
    virtualisation with Extended Page Tables (EPT), a guest
    VM may manipulate the memory management hardware to
    cause a Machine Check Error (MCE) and denial of service
    (hang or crash).

  The guest triggers this error by changing page tables without a TLB
  flush, so that both 4 KB and 2 MB entries for the same virtual
  address are loaded into the instruction TLB (iTLB). This update
  implements a mitigation in KVM that prevents guest VMs from loading
  2 MB entries into the iTLB. This will reduce performance of guest
  VMs.

  Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
  linux-doc-4.9 or linux-doc-4.19 package.

  A qemu update adding support for the PSCHANGE_MC_NO feature, which
  allows to disable iTLB Multihit mitigations in nested hypervisors
  will be provided via DSA 4566-1.

  Intel's explanation of the issue can be found at.

  - CVE-2019-0154
    Intel discovered that on their 8th and 9th generation
    GPUs, reading certain registers while the GPU is in a
    low-power state can cause a system hang. A local user
    permitted to use the GPU can use this for denial of
    service.

  This update mitigates the issue through changes to the i915 driver.

  The affected chips (gen8 and gen9) are listed at.

  - CVE-2019-0155
    Intel discovered that their 9th generation and newer
    GPUs are missing a security check in the Blitter Command
    Streamer (BCS). A local user permitted to use the GPU
    could use this to access any memory that the GPU has
    access to, which could result in a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), a leak of sensitive
    information, or privilege escalation.

  This update mitigates the issue by adding the security check to the
  i915 driver.

  The affected chips (gen9 onward) are listed at.

  - CVE-2019-11135
    It was discovered that on Intel CPUs supporting
    transactional memory (TSX), a transaction that is going
    to be aborted may continue to execute speculatively,
    reading sensitive data from internal buffers and leaking
    it through dependent operations. Intel calls this 'TSX
    Asynchronous Abort' (TAA).

  For CPUs affected by the previously published Microarchitectural
  Data Sampling (MDS) issues (CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127,
  CVE-2018-12130, CVE-2019-11091 ), the existing mitigation also
  mitigates this issue.

  For processors that are vulnerable to TAA but not MDS, this update
  disables TSX by default. This mitigation requires updated CPU
  microcode. An updated intel-microcode package (only available in
  Debian non-free) will be provided via DSA 4565-1. The updated CPU
  microcode may also be available as part of a system firmware
  ('BIOS') update.

    virtualisation with Extended Page Tables (EPT), a guest
    VM may manipulate the memory management hardware to
    cause a Machine Check Error (MCE) and denial of service
    (hang or crash).

  The guest triggers this error by changing page tables without a TLB
  flush, so that both 4 KB and 2 MB entries for the same virtual
  address are loaded into the instruction TLB (iTLB). This update
  implements a mitigation in KVM that prevents guest VMs from loading
  2 MB entries into the iTLB. This will reduce performance of guest
  VMs.

  Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
  linux-doc-4.9 or linux-doc-4.19 package.

  A qemu update adding support for the PSCHANGE_MC_NO feature, which
  allows to disable iTLB Multihit mitigations in nested hypervisors
  will be provided via DSA 4566-1.

  - CVE-2019-0154
    Intel discovered that on their 8th and 9th generation
    GPUs, reading certain registers while the GPU is in a
    low-power state can cause a system hang. A local user
    permitted to use the GPU can use this for denial of
    service.

  This update mitigates the issue through changes to the i915 driver.

  The affected chips (gen8 and gen9) are listed at.

  - CVE-2019-0155
    Intel discovered that their 9th generation and newer
    GPUs are missing a security check in the Blitter Command
    Streamer (BCS). A local user permitted to use the GPU
    could use this to access any memory that the GPU has
    access to, which could result in a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), a leak of sensitive
    information, or privilege escalation.

  This update mitigates the issue by adding the security check to the
  i915 driver.

  The affected chips (gen9 onward) are listed at.

  - CVE-2019-11135
    It was discovered that on Intel CPUs supporting
    transactional memory (TSX), a transaction that is going
    to be aborted may continue to execute speculatively,
    reading sensitive data from internal buffers and leaking
    it through dependent operations. Intel calls this 'TSX
    Asynchronous Abort' (TAA).

  For CPUs affected by the previously published Microarchitectural
  Data Sampling (MDS) issues (CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127,
  CVE-2018-12130, CVE-2019-11091 ), the existing mitigation also
  mitigates this issue.

  For processors that are vulnerable to TAA but not MDS, this update
  disables TSX by default. This mitigation requires updated CPU
  microcode. An updated intel-microcode package (only available in
  Debian non-free) will be provided via DSA 4565-1. The updated CPU
  microcode may also be available as part of a system firmware
  ('BIOS') update.

    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system
    using the vgacon driver could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-2182
    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the
    arm64 virtual memory management code, which could lead
    to an information disclosure, denial of service (crash),
    or possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-5108
    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE
    802.11 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it
    would trigger roaming for a newly associated station
    before the station was authenticated. An attacker within
    range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
    service, either by filling up a switching table or by
    redirecting traffic away from other stations.

  - CVE-2019-19319
    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause
    the ext4 implementation to deallocate or reallocate
    journal blocks. A user permitted to mount filesystems
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19462
    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the
    'relay' library used to implement various files under
    debugfs. A local user permitted to access debugfs could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19768
    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace
    debug facility that could result in a use-after-free. A
    local user able to trigger removal of block devices
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-20806
    A potential NULL pointer dereference was discovered in
    the tw5864 media driver. The security impact of this is
    unclear.

  - CVE-2019-20811
    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system
    using the vgacon driver could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some
related bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in
the macvlan driver introduced in the previous point release (bug
#952660).","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=952660

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-2182
    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the
    arm64 virtual memory management code, which could lead
    to an information disclosure, denial of service (crash),
    or possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-5108
    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE
    802.11 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it
    would trigger roaming for a newly associated station
    before the station was authenticated. An attacker within
    range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
    service, either by filling up a switching table or by
    redirecting traffic away from other stations.

  - CVE-2019-19319
    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause
    the ext4 implementation to deallocate or reallocate
    journal blocks. A user permitted to mount filesystems
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19462
    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the
    'relay' library used to implement various files under
    debugfs. A local user permitted to access debugfs could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19768
    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace
    debug facility that could result in a use-after-free. A
    local user able to trigger removal of block devices
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-20806
    A potential NULL pointer dereference was discovered in
    the tw5864 media driver. The security impact of this is
    unclear.

  - CVE-2019-20811
    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system
    using the vgacon driver could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some
related bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in
the macvlan driver introduced in the previous point release (bug
#952660).","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=952660

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-2182
    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the
    arm64 virtual memory management code, which could lead
    to an information disclosure, denial of service (crash),
    or possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-5108
    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE
    802.11 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it
    would trigger roaming for a newly associated station
    before the station was authenticated. An attacker within
    range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
    service, either by filling up a switching table or by
    redirecting traffic away from other stations.

  - CVE-2019-19319
    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause
    the ext4 implementation to deallocate or reallocate
    journal blocks. A user permitted to mount filesystems
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19462
    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the
    'relay' library used to implement various files under
    debugfs. A local user permitted to access debugfs could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19768
    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace
    debug facility that could result in a use-after-free. A
    local user able to trigger removal of block devices
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-20806
    A potential NULL pointer dereference was discovered in
    the tw5864 media driver. The security impact of this is
    unclear.

  - CVE-2019-20811
    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system
    using the vgacon driver could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some
related bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in
the macvlan driver introduced in the previous point release (bug
#952660).","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=952660

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-2182
    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the
    arm64 virtual memory management code, which could lead
    to an information disclosure, denial of service (crash),
    or possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-5108
    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE
    802.11 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it
    would trigger roaming for a newly associated station
    before the station was authenticated. An attacker within
    range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
    service, either by filling up a switching table or by
    redirecting traffic away from other stations.

  - CVE-2019-19319
    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause
    the ext4 implementation to deallocate or reallocate
    journal blocks. A user permitted to mount filesystems
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19462
    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the
    'relay' library used to implement various files under
    debugfs. A local user permitted to access debugfs could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19768
    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace
    debug facility that could result in a use-after-free. A
    local user able to trigger removal of block devices
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-20806
    A potential NULL pointer dereference was discovered in
    the tw5864 media driver. The security impact of this is
    unclear.

  - CVE-2019-20811
    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system
    using the vgacon driver could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some
related bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in
the macvlan driver introduced in the previous point release (bug
#952660).","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=952660

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-2182
    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the
    arm64 virtual memory management code, which could lead
    to an information disclosure, denial of service (crash),
    or possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-5108
    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE
    802.11 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it
    would trigger roaming for a newly associated station
    before the station was authenticated. An attacker within
    range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
    service, either by filling up a switching table or by
    redirecting traffic away from other stations.

  - CVE-2019-19319
    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause
    the ext4 implementation to deallocate or reallocate
    journal blocks. A user permitted to mount filesystems
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19462
    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the
    'relay' library used to implement various files under
    debugfs. A local user permitted to access debugfs could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19768
    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace
    debug facility that could result in a use-after-free. A
    local user able to trigger removal of block devices
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-20806
    A potential NULL pointer dereference was discovered in
    the tw5864 media driver. The security impact of this is
    unclear.

  - CVE-2019-20811
    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system
    using the vgacon driver could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some
related bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in
the macvlan driver introduced in the previous point release (bug

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction

    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some

    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is

    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some

    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some
related bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in
the macvlan driver introduced in the previous point release (bug
#952660).","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=952660

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-2182
    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the
    arm64 virtual memory management code, which could lead
    to an information disclosure, denial of service (crash),
    or possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-5108
    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE
    802.11 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it
    would trigger roaming for a newly associated station
    before the station was authenticated. An attacker within
    range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
    service, either by filling up a switching table or by
    redirecting traffic away from other stations.

  - CVE-2019-19319
    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause
    the ext4 implementation to deallocate or reallocate
    journal blocks. A user permitted to mount filesystems
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19462
    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the
    'relay' library used to implement various files under
    debugfs. A local user permitted to access debugfs could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19768
    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace
    debug facility that could result in a use-after-free. A
    local user able to trigger removal of block devices
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-20806
    A potential NULL pointer dereference was discovered in
    the tw5864 media driver. The security impact of this is
    unclear.

  - CVE-2019-20811
    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system

    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some
related bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-2182
    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the
    arm64 virtual memory management code, which could lead
    to an information disclosure, denial of service (crash),
    or possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-5108
    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE
    802.11 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it
    would trigger roaming for a newly associated station
    before the station was authenticated. An attacker within
    range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
    service, either by filling up a switching table or by
    redirecting traffic away from other stations.

  - CVE-2019-19319
    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause
    the ext4 implementation to deallocate or reallocate
    journal blocks. A user permitted to mount filesystems
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19462
    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the
    'relay' library used to implement various files under
    debugfs. A local user permitted to access debugfs could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19768
    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace
    debug facility that could result in a use-after-free. A
    local user able to trigger removal of block devices
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-20806
    A potential NULL pointer dereference was discovered in
    the tw5864 media driver. The security impact of this is
    unclear.

  - CVE-2019-20811
    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system
    using the vgacon driver could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some
related bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in
the macvlan driver introduced in the previous point release (bug

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-2182
    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the
    arm64 virtual memory management code, which could lead
    to an information disclosure, denial of service (crash),
    or possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-5108
    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE
    802.11 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it
    would trigger roaming for a newly associated station
    before the station was authenticated. An attacker within
    range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
    service, either by filling up a switching table or by
    redirecting traffic away from other stations.

  - CVE-2019-19319
    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause
    the ext4 implementation to deallocate or reallocate
    journal blocks. A user permitted to mount filesystems
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19462
    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the
    'relay' library used to implement various files under
    debugfs. A local user permitted to access debugfs could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19768
    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace
    debug facility that could result in a use-after-free. A
    local user able to trigger removal of block devices
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-20806
    A potential NULL pointer dereference was discovered in
    the tw5864 media driver. The security impact of this is
    unclear.

  - CVE-2019-20811
    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system
    using the vgacon driver could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of

    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-2182
    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the
    arm64 virtual memory management code, which could lead
    to an information disclosure, denial of service (crash),
    or possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-5108
    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE
    802.11 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it
    would trigger roaming for a newly associated station
    before the station was authenticated. An attacker within
    range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
    service, either by filling up a switching table or by
    redirecting traffic away from other stations.

  - CVE-2019-19319
    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause
    the ext4 implementation to deallocate or reallocate
    journal blocks. A user permitted to mount filesystems
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19462
    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the
    'relay' library used to implement various files under
    debugfs. A local user permitted to access debugfs could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19768
    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace
    debug facility that could result in a use-after-free. A
    local user able to trigger removal of block devices
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-20806
    A potential NULL pointer dereference was discovered in
    the tw5864 media driver. The security impact of this is
    unclear.

  - CVE-2019-20811
    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system
    using the vgacon driver could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

  - CVE-2019-2182
    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the
    arm64 virtual memory management code, which could lead
    to an information disclosure, denial of service (crash),
    or possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-5108
    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE
    802.11 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it
    would trigger roaming for a newly associated station
    before the station was authenticated. An attacker within
    range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
    service, either by filling up a switching table or by
    redirecting traffic away from other stations.

  - CVE-2019-19319
    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause
    the ext4 implementation to deallocate or reallocate
    journal blocks. A user permitted to mount filesystems
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19462
    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the
    'relay' library used to implement various files under
    debugfs. A local user permitted to access debugfs could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-19768
    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace
    debug facility that could result in a use-after-free. A
    local user able to trigger removal of block devices
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2019-20806
    A potential NULL pointer dereference was discovered in
    the tw5864 media driver. The security impact of this is
    unclear.

  - CVE-2019-20811
    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an
    error path in the network subsystem. The security impact
    of this is unclear.

  - CVE-2020-0543
    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some
    Intel CPUs supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED
    instructions, part of a random value generated by these
    instructions may be used in a later speculative
    execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by
    applications, a local user or VM guest could use this to
    obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
    from other users or VMs.

  This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either as
  part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
  package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
  only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
  disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

  - CVE-2020-2732
    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for
    Intel processors did not properly handle instruction
    emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is
    enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
    the L1 guest.

  - CVE-2020-8428
    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    filesystem core (vfs). A local user could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

  - CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649
    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds
    access in the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to
    access a virtual terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system
    using the vgacon driver could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-8648
    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the
    virtual terminal driver, which could result in a
    use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-9383
    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the
    floppy driver which could lead to a static out-of-bounds
    access. A local user permitted to access a floppy drive
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-10711
    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues
    in the SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet
    with null category. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash). Note
    that this issue does not affect the binary packages
    distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

  - CVE-2020-10732
    An information leak of kernel private memory to
    userspace was found in the kernel's implementation of
    core dumping userspace processes.

  - CVE-2020-10751
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did
    not properly handle validating multiple messages, which
    could allow a privileged attacker to bypass SELinux
    netlink restrictions.

  - CVE-2020-10757
    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX
    hugepages, allowing a local user to escalate their
    privileges

  - CVE-2020-10942
    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not
    properly validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could
    use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted system
    calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11494
    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN)
    network driver did not fully initialise CAN headers for
    received packets, resulting in an information leak from
    the kernel to user-space or over the CAN network.

  - CVE-2020-11565
    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem
    (tmpfs) did not correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option
    specifying an empty node list, leading to a stack-based
    out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are enabled, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668
    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and
    xirlink_cit media drivers did not properly validate USB
    device descriptors. A physically present user with a
    specially constructed USB device could use this to cause
    a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12114
    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the
    umount and pivot_root operations in the filesystem core
    (vfs). A local user with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
    any user namespace could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

  - CVE-2020-12464
    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core
    that can result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how
    this can be exploited, but it could result in a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or privilege
    escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12652
    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage
    drivers. An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user
    memory twice, creating a race condition which could
    result in incorrect locking of internal data structures.
    A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12653
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a
    potential heap buffer overflow. A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

  - CVE-2020-12654
    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an
    access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer
    overflow. A malicious AP could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

  - CVE-2020-12770
    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did
    not correctly release internal resources in a particular
    error case. A local user permitted to access an sg
    device could possibly use this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

  - CVE-2020-13143
    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds
    write in the USB gadget subsystem. A local user
    permitted to write to the gadget configuration
    filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.","Upgrade the linux packages.

CVE-2019-12973

In OpenJPEG 2.3.1, there is excessive iteration in the
opj_t1_encode_cblks function of openjp2/t1.c. Remote attackers could
leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted
bmp file. This issue is similar to CVE-2018-6616.

CVE-2020-6851

OpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a heap-based buffer overflow in
opj_t1_clbl_decode_processor in openjp2/t1.c because of lack of
opj_j2k_update_image_dimensions validation.

CVE-2020-8112

opj_t1_clbl_decode_processor in openjp2/t1.c in OpenJPEG 2.3.1 through
2020-01-28 has a heap-based buffer overflow in the qmfbid==1 case, a
different issue than CVE-2020-6851.

CVE-2020-15389

jp2/opj_decompress.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a use-after-free
that can be triggered if there is a mix of valid and invalid files in
a directory operated on by the decompressor. Triggering a double-free
may also be possible. This is related to calling opj_image_destroy
twice.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.1.2-1.1+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjpeg2 packages.

CVE-2018-20406

Modules/_pickle.c has an integer overflow via a large LONG_BINPUT
value that is mishandled during a 'resize to twice the size' attempt.
This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is only relevant if the
pickle format is used for serializing tens or hundreds of gigabytes of
data.

CVE-2018-20852

http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok in Lib/http/cookiejar.py
does not correctly validate the domain: it can be tricked into sending
existing cookies to the wrong server. An attacker may abuse this flaw
by using a server with a hostname that has another valid hostname as a
suffix (e.g., pythonicexample.com to steal cookies for example.com).
When a program uses http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy and tries to do an
HTTP connection to an attacker-controlled server, existing cookies can
be leaked to the attacker.

CVE-2019-5010

An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the X509
certificate parser. A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause a
NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An
attacker can initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted
certificates to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2019-9636

Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure
(credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname).
The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The
attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed
to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to
a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if the
attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the
query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a
Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if the
attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the path
component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP
header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query
string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file:
URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

A security regression was discovered in python, which still allows an
attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password
parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store
cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it
is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make
the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies,
authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it
should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an
attack may vary based on the application.

CVE-2019-16056

The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple
@ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements
some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be
tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An
attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies
to Python more generally.

CVE-2019-16935

The documentation XML-RPC server has XSS via the server_title field.
This occurs in Lib/xmlrpc/server.py. If set_server_title is called
with untrusted input, arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered to clients
that visit the http URL for this server.

CVE-2019-18348

An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if the
attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the host
component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This is similar to the
CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the CVE-2019-9947 path string
issue

CVE-2020-8492

Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial of
Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

CVE-2020-14422

Lib/ipaddress.py improperly computes hash values in the IPv4Interface
and IPv6Interface classes, which might allow a remote attacker to
cause a denial of service if an application is affected by the
performance of a dictionary containing IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface
objects, and this attacker can cause many dictionary entries to be
created.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version

CVE-2018-20406

Modules/_pickle.c has an integer overflow via a large LONG_BINPUT
value that is mishandled during a 'resize to twice the size' attempt.
This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is only relevant if the
pickle format is used for serializing tens or hundreds of gigabytes of
data.

CVE-2018-20852

http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok in Lib/http/cookiejar.py
does not correctly validate the domain: it can be tricked into sending
existing cookies to the wrong server. An attacker may abuse this flaw
by using a server with a hostname that has another valid hostname as a
suffix (e.g., pythonicexample.com to steal cookies for example.com).
When a program uses http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy and tries to do an
HTTP connection to an attacker-controlled server, existing cookies can
be leaked to the attacker.

CVE-2019-5010

An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the X509
certificate parser. A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause a
NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An
attacker can initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted
certificates to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2019-9636

Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure
(credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname).
The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The
attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed
to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to
a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if the
attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the
query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a
Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if the
attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the path
component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP
header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query
string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file:
URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

A security regression was discovered in python, which still allows an
attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password
parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store
cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it
is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make
the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies,
authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it
should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an
attack may vary based on the application.

CVE-2019-16056

The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple
@ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements
some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be
tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An
attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies
to Python more generally.

CVE-2019-16935

The documentation XML-RPC server has XSS via the server_title field.
This occurs in Lib/xmlrpc/server.py. If set_server_title is called
with untrusted input, arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered to clients
that visit the http URL for this server.

CVE-2019-18348

An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if the
attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the host
component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This is similar to the
CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the CVE-2019-9947 path string
issue

CVE-2020-8492

Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial of
Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

CVE-2020-14422

Lib/ipaddress.py improperly computes hash values in the IPv4Interface
and IPv6Interface classes, which might allow a remote attacker to
cause a denial of service if an application is affected by the
performance of a dictionary containing IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface
objects, and this attacker can cause many dictionary entries to be
created.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.3-1+deb9u2.

CVE-2019-9948

urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file:
URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

A security regression was discovered in python, which still allows an
attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password
parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store
cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it
is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make
the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies,
authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it
should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an
attack may vary based on the application.

CVE-2019-16056

The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple
@ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements
some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be
tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An
attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies
to Python more generally.

CVE-2019-16935

The documentation XML-RPC server has XSS via the server_title field.
This occurs in Lib/xmlrpc/server.py. If set_server_title is called
with untrusted input, arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered to clients
that visit the http URL for this server.

CVE-2019-18348

An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if the
attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the host
component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This is similar to the
CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the CVE-2019-9947 path string
issue

CVE-2020-8492

Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial of
Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

CVE-2020-14422

Lib/ipaddress.py improperly computes hash values in the IPv4Interface
and IPv6Interface classes, which might allow a remote attacker to
cause a denial of service if an application is affected by the
performance of a dictionary containing IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface
objects, and this attacker can cause many dictionary entries to be
created.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.3-1+deb9u2.

CVE-2018-20406

Modules/_pickle.c has an integer overflow via a large LONG_BINPUT
value that is mishandled during a 'resize to twice the size' attempt.
This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is only relevant if the
pickle format is used for serializing tens or hundreds of gigabytes of
data.

CVE-2018-20852

http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok in Lib/http/cookiejar.py
does not correctly validate the domain: it can be tricked into sending
existing cookies to the wrong server. An attacker may abuse this flaw
by using a server with a hostname that has another valid hostname as a
suffix (e.g., pythonicexample.com to steal cookies for example.com).
When a program uses http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy and tries to do an
HTTP connection to an attacker-controlled server, existing cookies can
be leaked to the attacker.

CVE-2019-5010

An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the X509
certificate parser. A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause a
NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An
attacker can initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted
certificates to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2019-9636

Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure
(credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname).
The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The
attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed
to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to
a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

CVE-2018-20852

By using a malicious server an attacker might steal cookies that are
meant for other domains.

CVE-2019-5010

NULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.

CVE-2019-9636

Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure
(credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname).
A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies
or authentication data and send that information to a different host
than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible if
the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the
query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a
Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible if
the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the path
component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP
header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query
string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file:
URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered which still
allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs
to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of
information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially
crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information
(e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host
than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed.
The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

CVE-2019-16056

The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple
@ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements
some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be
tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied.

CVE-2019-20907

Opening a crafted tar file could result in an infinite loop due to
missing header validation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version

CVE-2018-20852

By using a malicious server an attacker might steal cookies that are
meant for other domains.

CVE-2019-5010

NULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.

CVE-2019-9636

Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure
(credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname).
A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies
or authentication data and send that information to a different host
than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible if
the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the
query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a
Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible if
the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the path
component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP
header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query
string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file:
URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered which still
allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs
to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of
information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially
crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information
(e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host
than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed.
The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

CVE-2019-16056

The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple
@ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements
some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be
tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied.

CVE-2019-20907

Opening a crafted tar file could result in an infinite loop due to
missing header validation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.13-2+deb9u4.

protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of

protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2019-9445

A potential out-of-bounds read was discovered in the F2FS
implementation. A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
filesystems could potentially use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or to read sensitive information.

CVE-2019-19073, CVE-2019-19074

Navid Emamdoost discovered potential memory leaks in the ath9k and
ath9k_htc drivers. The security impact of these is unclear.

CVE-2019-19448

'Team bobfuzzer' reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to a
use-after-free, and could be triggered by crafted filesystem images. A
user permitted to mount and access arbitrary filesystems could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12351

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation in the
way L2CAP packets with A2MP CID are handled. A remote attacker within
a short distance, knowing the victim's Bluetooth device address, can
send a malicious l2cap packet and cause a denial of service or
possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.

CVE-2020-12352

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation. Stack
memory is not properly initialised when handling certain AMP packets.
A remote attacker within a short distance, knowing the victim's
Bluetooth device address address, can retrieve kernel stack
information.

CVE-2020-12655

Zheng Bin reported that crafted XFS volumes could trigger a system
hang. An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause
a denial of service.

CVE-2020-12771

Zhiqiang Liu reported a bug in the bcache block driver that could lead
to a system hang. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-12888

It was discovered that the PCIe Virtual Function I/O (vfio-pci) driver
allowed users to disable a device's memory space while it was still
mapped into a process. On some hardware platforms, local users or
guest virtual machines permitted to access PCIe Virtual Functions
could use this to cause a denial of service (hardware error and
crash).

CVE-2020-14305

Vasily Averin of Virtuozzo discovered a potential heap buffer overflow
in the netfilter nf_contrack_h323 module. When this module is used to
perform connection tracking for TCP/IPv6, a remote attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for remote code execution with kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-14314

A bug was discovered in the ext4 filesystem that could lead to an
out-of-bound read. A local user permitted to mount and access
arbitrary filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

CVE-2020-14331

A bug was discovered in the VGA console driver's soft-scrollback
feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow. On a system with a
custom kernel that has CONFIG_VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK enabled, a local
user with access to a console could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-14356, CVE-2020-25220

A bug was discovered in the cgroup subsystem's handling of socket
references to cgroups. In some cgroup configurations, this could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user might be able to use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

The original fix for this bug introudced a new security
issue, which is also addressed in this update.

CVE-2020-14386

Or Cohen discovered a bug in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
implementation which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. A local
user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace) could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14390

Minh Yuan discovered a bug in the framebuffer console driver's
scrollback feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow. On a
system using framebuffer consoles, a local user with access to a
console could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

The scrollback feature has been disabled for now, as no
other fix was available for this issue.

CVE-2020-15393

Kyungtae Kim reported a memory leak in the usbtest driver. The
security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-16166

Amit Klein reported that the random number generator used by the
network stack might not be re-seeded for long periods of time, making
e.g. client port number allocations more predictable. This made it
easier for remote attackers to carry out some network- based attacks
such as DNS cache poisoning or device tracking.

CVE-2020-24490

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation that can
lead to a heap buffer overflow. On systems with a Bluetooth 5 hardware
interface, a remote attacker within a short distance can use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
remote code execution with kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-25211

A flaw was discovered in netfilter subsystem. A local attacker able to
inject conntrack Netlink configuration can cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-25212

A bug was discovered in the NFSv4 client implementation that could
lead to a heap buffer overflow. A malicious NFS server could use this
to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
to execute arbitrary code on the client.

CVE-2020-25284

It was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver allowed
tasks running as uid 0 to add and remove rbd devices, even if they
dropped capabilities. On a system with the rbd driver loaded, this
might allow privilege escalation from a container with a task running
as root.

CVE-2020-25285

A race condition was discovered in the hugetlb filesystem's sysctl
handlers, that could lead to stack corruption. A local user permitted
to write to hugepages sysctls could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation. By default only the root user can do this.

CVE-2020-25641

The syzbot tool found a bug in the block layer that could lead to an
infinite loop. A local user with access to a raw block device could
use this to cause a denial of service (unbounded CPU use and possible
system hang).

CVE-2020-25643

ChenNan Of Chaitin Security Research Lab discovered a flaw in the
hdlc_ppp module. Improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr()
function may lead to memory corruption and information disclosure.

CVE-2020-26088

It was discovered that the NFC (Near Field Communication) socket
implementation allowed any user to create raw sockets. On a system
with an NFC interface, this allowed local users to evade local network
security policy.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.240-1. This update additionally includes many more bug fixes from

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2019-9445

A potential out-of-bounds read was discovered in the F2FS
implementation. A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
filesystems could potentially use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or to read sensitive information.

CVE-2019-19073, CVE-2019-19074

Navid Emamdoost discovered potential memory leaks in the ath9k and
ath9k_htc drivers. The security impact of these is unclear.

CVE-2019-19448

'Team bobfuzzer' reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to a
use-after-free, and could be triggered by crafted filesystem images. A
user permitted to mount and access arbitrary filesystems could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12351

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation in the
way L2CAP packets with A2MP CID are handled. A remote attacker within
a short distance, knowing the victim's Bluetooth device address, can
send a malicious l2cap packet and cause a denial of service or
possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.

CVE-2020-12352

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation. Stack
memory is not properly initialised when handling certain AMP packets.
A remote attacker within a short distance, knowing the victim's
Bluetooth device address address, can retrieve kernel stack
information.

CVE-2020-12655

Zheng Bin reported that crafted XFS volumes could trigger a system
hang. An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause
a denial of service.

CVE-2020-12771

Zhiqiang Liu reported a bug in the bcache block driver that could lead
to a system hang. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-12888

It was discovered that the PCIe Virtual Function I/O (vfio-pci) driver
allowed users to disable a device's memory space while it was still
mapped into a process. On some hardware platforms, local users or
guest virtual machines permitted to access PCIe Virtual Functions
could use this to cause a denial of service (hardware error and
crash).

CVE-2020-14305

Vasily Averin of Virtuozzo discovered a potential heap buffer overflow
in the netfilter nf_contrack_h323 module. When this module is used to
perform connection tracking for TCP/IPv6, a remote attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for remote code execution with kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-14314

A bug was discovered in the ext4 filesystem that could lead to an
out-of-bound read. A local user permitted to mount and access
arbitrary filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

CVE-2020-14331

A bug was discovered in the VGA console driver's soft-scrollback
feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow. On a system with a
custom kernel that has CONFIG_VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK enabled, a local
user with access to a console could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-14356, CVE-2020-25220

A bug was discovered in the cgroup subsystem's handling of socket
references to cgroups. In some cgroup configurations, this could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user might be able to use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

The original fix for this bug introudced a new security
issue, which is also addressed in this update.

CVE-2020-14386

Or Cohen discovered a bug in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
implementation which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. A local
user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace) could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14390

Minh Yuan discovered a bug in the framebuffer console driver's
scrollback feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow. On a
system using framebuffer consoles, a local user with access to a
console could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

The scrollback feature has been disabled for now, as no
other fix was available for this issue.

CVE-2020-15393

Kyungtae Kim reported a memory leak in the usbtest driver. The
security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-16166

Amit Klein reported that the random number generator used by the
network stack might not be re-seeded for long periods of time, making
e.g. client port number allocations more predictable. This made it
easier for remote attackers to carry out some network- based attacks
such as DNS cache poisoning or device tracking.

CVE-2020-24490

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation that can
lead to a heap buffer overflow. On systems with a Bluetooth 5 hardware
interface, a remote attacker within a short distance can use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
remote code execution with kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-25211

A flaw was discovered in netfilter subsystem. A local attacker able to
inject conntrack Netlink configuration can cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-25212

A bug was discovered in the NFSv4 client implementation that could
lead to a heap buffer overflow. A malicious NFS server could use this
to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
to execute arbitrary code on the client.

CVE-2020-25284

It was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver allowed
tasks running as uid 0 to add and remove rbd devices, even if they
dropped capabilities. On a system with the rbd driver loaded, this
might allow privilege escalation from a container with a task running
as root.

CVE-2020-25285

A race condition was discovered in the hugetlb filesystem's sysctl
handlers, that could lead to stack corruption. A local user permitted
to write to hugepages sysctls could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation. By default only the root user can do this.

CVE-2020-25641

The syzbot tool found a bug in the block layer that could lead to an
infinite loop. A local user with access to a raw block device could
use this to cause a denial of service (unbounded CPU use and possible
system hang).

CVE-2020-25643

ChenNan Of Chaitin Security Research Lab discovered a flaw in the
hdlc_ppp module. Improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr()
function may lead to memory corruption and information disclosure.

CVE-2020-26088

It was discovered that the NFC (Near Field Communication) socket
implementation allowed any user to create raw sockets. On a system
with an NFC interface, this allowed local users to evade local network
security policy.

filesystems could potentially use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or to read sensitive information.

CVE-2019-19073, CVE-2019-19074

Navid Emamdoost discovered potential memory leaks in the ath9k and
ath9k_htc drivers. The security impact of these is unclear.

CVE-2019-19448

'Team bobfuzzer' reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to a
use-after-free, and could be triggered by crafted filesystem images. A
user permitted to mount and access arbitrary filesystems could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12351

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation in the
way L2CAP packets with A2MP CID are handled. A remote attacker within
a short distance, knowing the victim's Bluetooth device address, can
send a malicious l2cap packet and cause a denial of service or
possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.

CVE-2020-12352

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation. Stack
memory is not properly initialised when handling certain AMP packets.
A remote attacker within a short distance, knowing the victim's
Bluetooth device address address, can retrieve kernel stack
information.

CVE-2020-12655

Zheng Bin reported that crafted XFS volumes could trigger a system
hang. An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause
a denial of service.

CVE-2020-12771

Zhiqiang Liu reported a bug in the bcache block driver that could lead
to a system hang. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-12888

It was discovered that the PCIe Virtual Function I/O (vfio-pci) driver
allowed users to disable a device's memory space while it was still
mapped into a process. On some hardware platforms, local users or
guest virtual machines permitted to access PCIe Virtual Functions
could use this to cause a denial of service (hardware error and
crash).

CVE-2020-14305

Vasily Averin of Virtuozzo discovered a potential heap buffer overflow
in the netfilter nf_contrack_h323 module. When this module is used to
perform connection tracking for TCP/IPv6, a remote attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for remote code execution with kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-14314

A bug was discovered in the ext4 filesystem that could lead to an
out-of-bound read. A local user permitted to mount and access
arbitrary filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

CVE-2020-14331

A bug was discovered in the VGA console driver's soft-scrollback
feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow. On a system with a
custom kernel that has CONFIG_VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK enabled, a local
user with access to a console could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-14356, CVE-2020-25220

A bug was discovered in the cgroup subsystem's handling of socket
references to cgroups. In some cgroup configurations, this could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user might be able to use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

The original fix for this bug introudced a new security
issue, which is also addressed in this update.

CVE-2020-14386

Or Cohen discovered a bug in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
implementation which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. A local
user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace) could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14390

Minh Yuan discovered a bug in the framebuffer console driver's
scrollback feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow. On a
system using framebuffer consoles, a local user with access to a
console could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

The scrollback feature has been disabled for now, as no
other fix was available for this issue.

CVE-2020-15393

Kyungtae Kim reported a memory leak in the usbtest driver. The
security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-16166

Amit Klein reported that the random number generator used by the
network stack might not be re-seeded for long periods of time, making
e.g. client port number allocations more predictable. This made it
easier for remote attackers to carry out some network- based attacks
such as DNS cache poisoning or device tracking.

CVE-2020-24490

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation that can
lead to a heap buffer overflow. On systems with a Bluetooth 5 hardware
interface, a remote attacker within a short distance can use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
remote code execution with kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-25211

A flaw was discovered in netfilter subsystem. A local attacker able to
inject conntrack Netlink configuration can cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-25212

A bug was discovered in the NFSv4 client implementation that could
lead to a heap buffer overflow. A malicious NFS server could use this
to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
to execute arbitrary code on the client.

CVE-2020-25284

It was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver allowed
tasks running as uid 0 to add and remove rbd devices, even if they
dropped capabilities. On a system with the rbd driver loaded, this
might allow privilege escalation from a container with a task running
as root.

CVE-2020-25285

A race condition was discovered in the hugetlb filesystem's sysctl
handlers, that could lead to stack corruption. A local user permitted
to write to hugepages sysctls could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation. By default only the root user can do this.

CVE-2020-25641

The syzbot tool found a bug in the block layer that could lead to an
infinite loop. A local user with access to a raw block device could
use this to cause a denial of service (unbounded CPU use and possible
system hang).

CVE-2020-25643

ChenNan Of Chaitin Security Research Lab discovered a flaw in the
hdlc_ppp module. Improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr()
function may lead to memory corruption and information disclosure.

CVE-2020-26088

It was discovered that the NFC (Near Field Communication) socket
implementation allowed any user to create raw sockets. On a system
with an NFC interface, this allowed local users to evade local network
security policy.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2019-9445

A potential out-of-bounds read was discovered in the F2FS
implementation. A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
filesystems could potentially use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or to read sensitive information.

CVE-2019-19073, CVE-2019-19074

Navid Emamdoost discovered potential memory leaks in the ath9k and
ath9k_htc drivers. The security impact of these is unclear.

CVE-2019-19448

'Team bobfuzzer' reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to a
use-after-free, and could be triggered by crafted filesystem images. A
user permitted to mount and access arbitrary filesystems could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12351

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation in the
way L2CAP packets with A2MP CID are handled. A remote attacker within
a short distance, knowing the victim's Bluetooth device address, can
send a malicious l2cap packet and cause a denial of service or
possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.

CVE-2020-12352

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation. Stack
memory is not properly initialised when handling certain AMP packets.
A remote attacker within a short distance, knowing the victim's
Bluetooth device address address, can retrieve kernel stack
information.

CVE-2020-12655

Zheng Bin reported that crafted XFS volumes could trigger a system
hang. An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause
a denial of service.

CVE-2020-12771

Zhiqiang Liu reported a bug in the bcache block driver that could lead
to a system hang. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-12888

It was discovered that the PCIe Virtual Function I/O (vfio-pci) driver
allowed users to disable a device's memory space while it was still
mapped into a process. On some hardware platforms, local users or
guest virtual machines permitted to access PCIe Virtual Functions
could use this to cause a denial of service (hardware error and
crash).

CVE-2020-14305

Vasily Averin of Virtuozzo discovered a potential heap buffer overflow
in the netfilter nf_contrack_h323 module. When this module is used to
perform connection tracking for TCP/IPv6, a remote attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for remote code execution with kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-14314

A bug was discovered in the ext4 filesystem that could lead to an
out-of-bound read. A local user permitted to mount and access
arbitrary filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

CVE-2020-14331

A bug was discovered in the VGA console driver's soft-scrollback
feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow. On a system with a
custom kernel that has CONFIG_VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK enabled, a local
user with access to a console could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-14356, CVE-2020-25220

A bug was discovered in the cgroup subsystem's handling of socket
references to cgroups. In some cgroup configurations, this could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user might be able to use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

The original fix for this bug introudced a new security
issue, which is also addressed in this update.

CVE-2020-14386

Or Cohen discovered a bug in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
implementation which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. A local
user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace) could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14390

Minh Yuan discovered a bug in the framebuffer console driver's
scrollback feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow. On a
system using framebuffer consoles, a local user with access to a
console could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

The scrollback feature has been disabled for now, as no
other fix was available for this issue.

CVE-2020-15393

Kyungtae Kim reported a memory leak in the usbtest driver. The
security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-16166

Amit Klein reported that the random number generator used by the
network stack might not be re-seeded for long periods of time, making
e.g. client port number allocations more predictable. This made it
easier for remote attackers to carry out some network- based attacks
such as DNS cache poisoning or device tracking.

CVE-2020-24490

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation that can
lead to a heap buffer overflow. On systems with a Bluetooth 5 hardware
interface, a remote attacker within a short distance can use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
remote code execution with kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-25211

A flaw was discovered in netfilter subsystem. A local attacker able to
inject conntrack Netlink configuration can cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-25212

A bug was discovered in the NFSv4 client implementation that could
lead to a heap buffer overflow. A malicious NFS server could use this
to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
to execute arbitrary code on the client.

CVE-2020-25284

It was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver allowed
tasks running as uid 0 to add and remove rbd devices, even if they
dropped capabilities. On a system with the rbd driver loaded, this
might allow privilege escalation from a container with a task running
as root.

CVE-2020-25285

A race condition was discovered in the hugetlb filesystem's sysctl
handlers, that could lead to stack corruption. A local user permitted
to write to hugepages sysctls could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation. By default only the root user can do this.

CVE-2020-25641

The syzbot tool found a bug in the block layer that could lead to an
infinite loop. A local user with access to a raw block device could
use this to cause a denial of service (unbounded CPU use and possible
system hang).

CVE-2020-25643

ChenNan Of Chaitin Security Research Lab discovered a flaw in the
hdlc_ppp module. Improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr()
function may lead to memory corruption and information disclosure.

CVE-2020-26088

It was discovered that the NFC (Near Field Communication) socket
implementation allowed any user to create raw sockets. On a system
with an NFC interface, this allowed local users to evade local network
security policy.

CVE-2020-0427

Elena Petrova reported a bug in the pinctrl subsystem that can lead to
a use-after-free after a device is renamed. The security impact of
this is unclear.

CVE-2020-8694

Multiple researchers discovered that the powercap subsystem allowed
all users to read CPU energy meters, by default. On systems using
Intel CPUs, this provided a side channel that could leak sensitive
information between user processes, or from the kernel to user
processes. The energy meters are now readable only by root, by
default.

This issue can be mitigated by running :

chmod go-r /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj

This needs to be repeated each time the system is booted
with an unfixed kernel version.

CVE-2020-14351

A race condition was discovered in the performance events subsystem,
which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access
performance events could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged
users to access peformance events by default, which fully
mitigates this issue.

CVE-2020-25645

A flaw was discovered in the interface driver for GENEVE encapsulated
traffic when combined with IPsec. If IPsec is configured to encrypt
traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel, tunneled
data isn't correctly routed over the encrypted link and sent
unencrypted instead.

CVE-2020-25656

Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the virtual
terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free. A local user
with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25668

Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the virtual
terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free. A local user
with access to a virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG
capability, could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25669

Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Sun keyboard driver (sunkbd) that
could lead to a use-after-free. On a system using this driver, a local
user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25704

kiyin(&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) discovered a potential memory leak in the
performance events subsystem. A local user permitted to access
performance events could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
exhaustion).

Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged
users to access peformance events by default, which fully
mitigates this issue.

CVE-2020-25705

Keyu Man reported that strict rate-limiting of ICMP packet
transmission provided a side-channel that could help networked
attackers to carry out packet spoofing. In particular, this made it
practical for off-path networked attackers to 'poison' DNS caches with
spoofed responses ('SAD DNS' attack).

This issue has been mitigated by randomising whether packets
are counted against the rate limit.

CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332

Julien Grall from Arm discovered a bug in the Xen event handling code.
Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU) guests could
cause a denial of service (excessive CPU usage or hang) in dom0.

CVE-2020-27675 / XSA-331

Jinoh Kang of Theori discovered a race condition in the Xen event
handling code. Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU)
guests could cause a denial of service (crash) in dom0.

CVE-2020-28974

Yuan Ming discovered a bug in the virtual terminal (vt) driver that
could lead to an out-of-bounds read. A local user with access to a
virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, could
possibly use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or

CVE-2020-0427

Elena Petrova reported a bug in the pinctrl subsystem that can lead to
a use-after-free after a device is renamed. The security impact of
this is unclear.

CVE-2020-8694

Multiple researchers discovered that the powercap subsystem allowed
all users to read CPU energy meters, by default. On systems using
Intel CPUs, this provided a side channel that could leak sensitive
information between user processes, or from the kernel to user
processes. The energy meters are now readable only by root, by
default.

This issue can be mitigated by running :

chmod go-r /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj

This needs to be repeated each time the system is booted
with an unfixed kernel version.

CVE-2020-14351

A race condition was discovered in the performance events subsystem,
which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access
performance events could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged
users to access peformance events by default, which fully
mitigates this issue.

CVE-2020-25645

A flaw was discovered in the interface driver for GENEVE encapsulated
traffic when combined with IPsec. If IPsec is configured to encrypt
traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel, tunneled
data isn't correctly routed over the encrypted link and sent
unencrypted instead.

CVE-2020-25656

Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the virtual
terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free. A local user
with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25668

Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the virtual
terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free. A local user
with access to a virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG
capability, could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25669

Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Sun keyboard driver (sunkbd) that
could lead to a use-after-free. On a system using this driver, a local
user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25704

kiyin(&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) discovered a potential memory leak in the
performance events subsystem. A local user permitted to access
performance events could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
exhaustion).

Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged
users to access peformance events by default, which fully
mitigates this issue.

CVE-2020-25705

Keyu Man reported that strict rate-limiting of ICMP packet
transmission provided a side-channel that could help networked
attackers to carry out packet spoofing. In particular, this made it
practical for off-path networked attackers to 'poison' DNS caches with
spoofed responses ('SAD DNS' attack).

This issue has been mitigated by randomising whether packets
are counted against the rate limit.

CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332

Julien Grall from Arm discovered a bug in the Xen event handling code.
Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU) guests could
cause a denial of service (excessive CPU usage or hang) in dom0.

CVE-2020-27675 / XSA-331

Jinoh Kang of Theori discovered a race condition in the Xen event
handling code. Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU)
guests could cause a denial of service (crash) in dom0.

CVE-2020-28974

Yuan Ming discovered a bug in the virtual terminal (vt) driver that
could lead to an out-of-bounds read. A local user with access to a
virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, could
possibly use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or
to cause a denial of service (crash).

The specific ioctl operation affected by this bug
(KD_FONT_OP_COPY) has been disabled, as it is not believed

CVE-2020-0427

Elena Petrova reported a bug in the pinctrl subsystem that can lead to
a use-after-free after a device is renamed. The security impact of
this is unclear.

CVE-2020-8694

Multiple researchers discovered that the powercap subsystem allowed
all users to read CPU energy meters, by default. On systems using
Intel CPUs, this provided a side channel that could leak sensitive
information between user processes, or from the kernel to user
processes. The energy meters are now readable only by root, by
default.

This issue can be mitigated by running :

chmod go-r /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj

This needs to be repeated each time the system is booted
with an unfixed kernel version.

CVE-2020-14351

A race condition was discovered in the performance events subsystem,
which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access
performance events could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged
users to access peformance events by default, which fully
mitigates this issue.

CVE-2020-25645

A flaw was discovered in the interface driver for GENEVE encapsulated
traffic when combined with IPsec. If IPsec is configured to encrypt
traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel, tunneled
data isn't correctly routed over the encrypted link and sent
unencrypted instead.

CVE-2020-25656

Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the virtual
terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free. A local user
with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25668

Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the virtual
terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free. A local user
with access to a virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG
capability, could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25669

Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Sun keyboard driver (sunkbd) that
could lead to a use-after-free. On a system using this driver, a local
user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25704

kiyin(&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) discovered a potential memory leak in the
performance events subsystem. A local user permitted to access
performance events could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
exhaustion).

Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged
users to access peformance events by default, which fully
mitigates this issue.

CVE-2020-25705

Keyu Man reported that strict rate-limiting of ICMP packet
transmission provided a side-channel that could help networked
attackers to carry out packet spoofing. In particular, this made it
practical for off-path networked attackers to 'poison' DNS caches with
spoofed responses ('SAD DNS' attack).

This issue has been mitigated by randomising whether packets
are counted against the rate limit.

CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332

Julien Grall from Arm discovered a bug in the Xen event handling code.
Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU) guests could
cause a denial of service (excessive CPU usage or hang) in dom0.

CVE-2020-27675 / XSA-331

Jinoh Kang of Theori discovered a race condition in the Xen event
handling code. Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU)
guests could cause a denial of service (crash) in dom0.

CVE-2020-28974

Yuan Ming discovered a bug in the virtual terminal (vt) driver that
could lead to an out-of-bounds read. A local user with access to a
virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, could
possibly use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or
to cause a denial of service (crash).

The specific ioctl operation affected by this bug

for transferring data with URL syntax and an easy-to-use client-side
URL transfer library.

CVE-2020-8284

When curl performs a passive FTP transfer, it first tries the EPSV
command and if that is not supported, it falls back to using PASV.
Passive mode is what curl uses by default. A server response to a PASV
command includes the (IPv4) address and port number for the client to
connect back to in order to perform the actual data transfer. This is
how the FTP protocol is designed to work. A malicious server can use
the PASV response to trick curl into connecting back to a given IP
address and port, and this way potentially make curl extract
information about services that are otherwise private and not
disclosed, for example doing port scanning and service banner
extractions.

The IP address part of the response is now ignored by
default, by making CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP default to 1L
instead of previously being 0L. This has the minor drawback
that a small fraction of use cases might break, when a
server truly needs the client to connect back to a different
IP address than what the control connection uses and for
those CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP can be set to 0L. The same
goes for the command line tool, which then might need

--no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip set to prevent curl from ignoring the
address in the server response.

CVE-2020-8285

libcurl offers a wildcard matching functionality, which allows a
callback (set with CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION) to return information
back to libcurl on how to handle a specific entry in a directory when
libcurl iterates over a list of all available entries. When this
callback returns CURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_SKIP, to tell libcurl to not deal
with that file, the internal function in libcurl then calls itself
recursively to handle the next directory entry. If there's a
sufficient amount of file entries and if the callback returns 'skip'
enough number of times, libcurl runs out of stack space. The exact
amount will of course vary with platforms, compilers and other
environmental factors. The content of the remote directory is not kept
on the stack, so it seems hard for the attacker to control exactly
what data that overwrites the stack - however it remains a
denial of service vector as a malicious user who controls a server
that a libcurl-using application works with under these premises can
trigger a crash.

The internal function is rewritten to instead and more
appropriately use an ordinary loop instead of the recursive
approach. This way, the stack use will remain the same no
matter how many files that are skipped.

CVE-2020-8286

libcurl offers 'OCSP stapling' via the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS
option. When set, libcurl verifies the OCSP response that a server
responds with as part of the TLS handshake. It then aborts the TLS
negotiation if something is wrong with the response. The same feature
can be enabled with --cert-status using the curl tool. As part of the
OCSP response verification, a client should verify that the response
is indeed set out for the correct certificate. This step was not
performed by libcurl when built or told to use OpenSSL as TLS backend.
This flaw would allow an attacker, who perhaps could have breached a
TLS server, to provide a fraudulent OCSP response that would appear
fine, instead of the real one. Like if the original certificate
actually has been revoked.

The OCSP response checker function now also verifies that
the certificate id is the correct one.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version

denial of service vector as a malicious user who controls a server
that a libcurl-using application works with under these premises can
trigger a crash.

The internal function is rewritten to instead and more
appropriately use an ordinary loop instead of the recursive
approach. This way, the stack use will remain the same no
matter how many files that are skipped.

CVE-2020-8286

libcurl offers 'OCSP stapling' via the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS
option. When set, libcurl verifies the OCSP response that a server
responds with as part of the TLS handshake. It then aborts the TLS
negotiation if something is wrong with the response. The same feature
can be enabled with --cert-status using the curl tool. As part of the
OCSP response verification, a client should verify that the response
is indeed set out for the correct certificate. This step was not
performed by libcurl when built or told to use OpenSSL as TLS backend.
This flaw would allow an attacker, who perhaps could have breached a
TLS server, to provide a fraudulent OCSP response that would appear
fine, instead of the real one. Like if the original certificate
actually has been revoked.

The OCSP response checker function now also verifies that
the certificate id is the correct one.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
7.52.1-5+deb9u13.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

for transferring data with URL syntax and an easy-to-use client-side
URL transfer library.

CVE-2020-8284

When curl performs a passive FTP transfer, it first tries the EPSV
command and if that is not supported, it falls back to using PASV.
Passive mode is what curl uses by default. A server response to a PASV
command includes the (IPv4) address and port number for the client to
connect back to in order to perform the actual data transfer. This is
how the FTP protocol is designed to work. A malicious server can use
the PASV response to trick curl into connecting back to a given IP
address and port, and this way potentially make curl extract
information about services that are otherwise private and not
disclosed, for example doing port scanning and service banner
extractions.

The IP address part of the response is now ignored by
default, by making CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP default to 1L
instead of previously being 0L. This has the minor drawback
that a small fraction of use cases might break, when a
server truly needs the client to connect back to a different
IP address than what the control connection uses and for
those CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP can be set to 0L. The same
goes for the command line tool, which then might need

--no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip set to prevent curl from ignoring the
address in the server response.

CVE-2020-8285

libcurl offers a wildcard matching functionality, which allows a
callback (set with CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION) to return information
back to libcurl on how to handle a specific entry in a directory when
libcurl iterates over a list of all available entries. When this
callback returns CURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_SKIP, to tell libcurl to not deal
with that file, the internal function in libcurl then calls itself
recursively to handle the next directory entry. If there's a
sufficient amount of file entries and if the callback returns 'skip'
enough number of times, libcurl runs out of stack space. The exact
amount will of course vary with platforms, compilers and other
environmental factors. The content of the remote directory is not kept
on the stack, so it seems hard for the attacker to control exactly
what data that overwrites the stack - however it remains a
denial of service vector as a malicious user who controls a server
that a libcurl-using application works with under these premises can
trigger a crash.

image manipulation programs. An attacker could cause denial of service
and execution of arbitrary code when a crafted image file is
processed.

CVE-2017-14528

The TIFFSetProfiles function in coders/tiff.c has incorrect
expectations about whether LibTIFF TIFFGetField return values imply
that data validation has occurred, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (use-after-free after an invalid call to
TIFFSetField, and application crash) via a crafted file.

CVE-2020-19667

Stack-based buffer overflow and unconditional jump in ReadXPMImage in
coders/xpm.c

CVE-2020-25665

The PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to
AcquireQuantumMemory() in routine WritePALMImage() because it needs to
be offset by 256. This can cause a out-of-bounds read later on in the
routine. This could cause impact to reliability.

CVE-2020-25674

WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop
with an improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ
via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the
colormap to have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition
will loop 256 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the
event logger.

CVE-2020-27560

ImageMagick allows Division by Zero in OptimizeLayerFrames in
MagickCore/layer.c, which may cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-27750

A flaw was found in MagickCore/colorspace-private.h and
MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is
processedcould trigger undefined behavior in the form of values
outside the range of type `unsigned char` and math division by zero.
This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,
but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined
behavior.

CVE-2020-27760

In `GammaImage()` of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending on the `gamma`
value, it's possible to trigger a divide-by-zero condition when a
crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This could lead to an
impact to application availability.

CVE-2020-27763

A flaw was found in MagickCore/resize.c. An attacker who submits a
crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined
behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely
lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially
cause other problems related to undefined behavior.

CVE-2020-27765

A flaw was found in MagickCore/segment.c. An attacker who submits a
crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined
behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely
lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially
cause other problems related to undefined behavior.

CVE-2020-27773

A flaw was found in MagickCore/gem-private.h. An attacker who submits
a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type
`unsigned char` or division by zero. This would most likely lead to an
impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other
problems related to undefined behavior.

CVE-2020-29599

ImageMagick mishandles the -authenticate option, which allows setting
a password for password-protected PDF files. The user-controlled
password was not properly escaped/sanitized and it was therefore
possible to inject additional shell commands via coders/pdf.c.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u11.

image manipulation programs. An attacker could cause denial of service
and execution of arbitrary code when a crafted image file is
processed.

CVE-2017-14528

The TIFFSetProfiles function in coders/tiff.c has incorrect
expectations about whether LibTIFF TIFFGetField return values imply
that data validation has occurred, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (use-after-free after an invalid call to
TIFFSetField, and application crash) via a crafted file.

CVE-2020-19667

Stack-based buffer overflow and unconditional jump in ReadXPMImage in
coders/xpm.c

CVE-2020-25665

The PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to
AcquireQuantumMemory() in routine WritePALMImage() because it needs to
be offset by 256. This can cause a out-of-bounds read later on in the
routine. This could cause impact to reliability.

CVE-2020-25674

WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop
with an improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ
via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the
colormap to have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition
will loop 256 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the
event logger.

CVE-2020-27560

ImageMagick allows Division by Zero in OptimizeLayerFrames in
MagickCore/layer.c, which may cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-27750

A flaw was found in MagickCore/colorspace-private.h and
MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is
processedcould trigger undefined behavior in the form of values
outside the range of type `unsigned char` and math division by zero.
This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,
but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined
behavior.

CVE-2020-27760

In `GammaImage()` of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending on the `gamma`
value, it's possible to trigger a divide-by-zero condition when a
crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This could lead to an
impact to application availability.

CVE-2020-27763

A flaw was found in MagickCore/resize.c. An attacker who submits a
crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined
behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely
lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially
cause other problems related to undefined behavior.

CVE-2020-27765

A flaw was found in MagickCore/segment.c. An attacker who submits a
crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined
behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely
lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially
cause other problems related to undefined behavior.

CVE-2020-27773

A flaw was found in MagickCore/gem-private.h. An attacker who submits
a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type
`unsigned char` or division by zero. This would most likely lead to an
impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other
problems related to undefined behavior.

CVE-2020-29599

ImageMagick mishandles the -authenticate option, which allows setting
a password for password-protected PDF files. The user-controlled
password was not properly escaped/sanitized and it was therefore
possible to inject additional shell commands via coders/pdf.c.

by several security vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues.

CVE-2011-5325

A path traversal vulnerability was found in Busybox implementation of
tar. tar will extract a symlink that points outside of the current
working directory and then follow that symlink when extracting other
files. This allows for a directory traversal attack when extracting
untrusted tarballs.

CVE-2013-1813

When device node or symlink in /dev should be created inside
2-or-deeper subdirectory (/dev/dir1/dir2.../node), the intermediate
directories are created with incorrect permissions.

CVE-2014-4607

An integer overflow may occur when processing any variant of a
'literal run' in the lzo1x_decompress_safe function. Each of these
three locations is subject to an integer overflow when processing zero
bytes. This exposes the code that copies literals to memory
corruption.

CVE-2014-9645

The add_probe function in modutils/modprobe.c in BusyBox allows local
users to bypass intended restrictions on loading kernel modules via a
/ (slash) character in a module name, as demonstrated by an 'ifconfig
/usbserial up' command or a 'mount -t /snd_pcm none /' command.

CVE-2016-2147

Integer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed
RFC1035-encoded domain name, which triggers an out-of-bounds heap
write.

CVE-2016-2148

Heap-based buffer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox
allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors
involving OPTION_6RD parsing.

CVE-2017-15873

The get_next_block function in archival/libarchive
/decompress_bunzip2.c in BusyBox has an Integer Overflow that may lead
to a write access violation.

CVE-2017-16544

In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox, the tab
autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list of filenames in
a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in executing any
escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially result in code
execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks.

CVE-2018-1000517

BusyBox contains a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in Busybox wget that
can result in a heap-based buffer overflow. This attack appears to be
exploitable via network connectivity.

CVE-2015-9621

Unziping a specially crafted zip file results in a computation of an
invalid pointer and a crash reading an invalid address.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version

CVE-2011-5325

A path traversal vulnerability was found in Busybox implementation of
tar. tar will extract a symlink that points outside of the current
working directory and then follow that symlink when extracting other
files. This allows for a directory traversal attack when extracting
untrusted tarballs.

CVE-2013-1813

When device node or symlink in /dev should be created inside
2-or-deeper subdirectory (/dev/dir1/dir2.../node), the intermediate
directories are created with incorrect permissions.

CVE-2014-4607

An integer overflow may occur when processing any variant of a
'literal run' in the lzo1x_decompress_safe function. Each of these
three locations is subject to an integer overflow when processing zero
bytes. This exposes the code that copies literals to memory
corruption.

CVE-2014-9645

The add_probe function in modutils/modprobe.c in BusyBox allows local
users to bypass intended restrictions on loading kernel modules via a
/ (slash) character in a module name, as demonstrated by an 'ifconfig
/usbserial up' command or a 'mount -t /snd_pcm none /' command.

CVE-2016-2147

Integer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed
RFC1035-encoded domain name, which triggers an out-of-bounds heap
write.

CVE-2019-19318, CVE-2019-19813, CVE-2019-19816

'Team bobfuzzer' reported bugs in Btrfs that could lead to a
use-after-free or heap buffer overflow, and could be triggered by
crafted filesystem images. A user permitted to mount and access
arbitrary filesystems could use these to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-27815

A flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local
attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a denial
of service.

CVE-2020-27825

Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace ring
buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could result in
denial of service or information leak.

CVE-2020-28374

David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An attacker
with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number assignments
can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any LIO
backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.

CVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)

Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can
trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.

CVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)

Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free
flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A
misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting
/ disconnecting a block frontend.

CVE-2020-29660

Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty subsystem
which may allow a local attacker to mount a read-after-free attack
against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver which
could result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code
via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3178

&#x5434;&#x5F02; reported an information leak in the NFSv3 server.
When only a subdirectory of a filesystem volume is exported, an NFS
client listing the exported directory would obtain a file handle to
the parent directory, allowing it to access files that were not meant
to be exported.

Even after this update, it is still possible for NFSv3
clients to guess valid file handles and access files outside
an exported subdirectory, unless the 'subtree_check' export
option is enabled. It is recommended that you do not use
that option but only export whole filesystem volumes.

CVE-2021-3347

It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan H.
Sch&ouml;nherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
(xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A
malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of service
(crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege escalation,
within the domain running the backend, which is typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038

Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen
backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A
malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of service
(crash) within the domain running the backend, which is typically
dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs. On a
system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information leak to
local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
properly restrict access to its netlink management interface. On a
system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to
cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
correctly limit the lengths of parameters or 'passthrough PDUs' sent
through its netlink management interface. On a system acting as an
iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the contents of
kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel memory corruption

CVE-2020-29660

Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty subsystem
which may allow a local attacker to mount a read-after-free attack
against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver which
could result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code
via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3178

&#x5434;&#x5F02; reported an information leak in the NFSv3 server.
When only a subdirectory of a filesystem volume is exported, an NFS
client listing the exported directory would obtain a file handle to
the parent directory, allowing it to access files that were not meant
to be exported.

Even after this update, it is still possible for NFSv3
clients to guess valid file handles and access files outside
an exported subdirectory, unless the 'subtree_check' export
option is enabled. It is recommended that you do not use
that option but only export whole filesystem volumes.

CVE-2021-3347

It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan H.
Sch&ouml;nherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
(xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A
malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of service
(crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege escalation,
within the domain running the backend, which is typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038

backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A
malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of service
(crash) within the domain running the backend, which is typically
dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs. On a
system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information leak to
local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
properly restrict access to its netlink management interface. On a
system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to
cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
correctly limit the lengths of parameters or 'passthrough PDUs' sent
through its netlink management interface. On a system acting as an
iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the contents of
kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel memory corruption
or crash), and probably for privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.258-1.

CVE-2019-19318, CVE-2019-19813, CVE-2019-19816

'Team bobfuzzer' reported bugs in Btrfs that could lead to a
use-after-free or heap buffer overflow, and could be triggered by
crafted filesystem images. A user permitted to mount and access
arbitrary filesystems could use these to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-27815

A flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local
attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a denial
of service.

CVE-2020-27825

Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace ring
buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could result in
denial of service or information leak.

CVE-2020-28374

David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An attacker
with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number assignments
can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any LIO
backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.

CVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)

Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can
trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.

CVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)

Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free
flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A
misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting
/ disconnecting a block frontend.

CVE-2020-29660

Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty subsystem
which may allow a local attacker to mount a read-after-free attack
against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver which
could result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code
via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3178

&#x5434;&#x5F02; reported an information leak in the NFSv3 server.
When only a subdirectory of a filesystem volume is exported, an NFS
client listing the exported directory would obtain a file handle to
the parent directory, allowing it to access files that were not meant
to be exported.

Even after this update, it is still possible for NFSv3
clients to guess valid file handles and access files outside
an exported subdirectory, unless the 'subtree_check' export
option is enabled. It is recommended that you do not use
that option but only export whole filesystem volumes.

CVE-2021-3347

It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan H.
Sch&ouml;nherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
(xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A
malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of service
(crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege escalation,
within the domain running the backend, which is typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038
(XSA-367)

Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen
backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A
malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of service
(crash) within the domain running the backend, which is typically
dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs. On a
system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information leak to
local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
properly restrict access to its netlink management interface. On a
system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to
cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
correctly limit the lengths of parameters or 'passthrough PDUs' sent
through its netlink management interface. On a system acting as an
iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the contents of
kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel memory corruption

dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs. On a
system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information leak to
local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
properly restrict access to its netlink management interface. On a
system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to
cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
correctly limit the lengths of parameters or 'passthrough PDUs' sent
through its netlink management interface. On a system acting as an
iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the contents of
kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel memory corruption
or crash), and probably for privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.258-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

CVE-2020-28374

David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An attacker
with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number assignments
can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any LIO
backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.

CVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)

Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can
trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.

CVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)

Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free
flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A
misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting
/ disconnecting a block frontend.

CVE-2020-29660

Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty subsystem
which may allow a local attacker to mount a read-after-free attack
against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver which
could result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code
via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3178

&#x5434;&#x5F02; reported an information leak in the NFSv3 server.
When only a subdirectory of a filesystem volume is exported, an NFS
client listing the exported directory would obtain a file handle to
the parent directory, allowing it to access files that were not meant
to be exported.

Even after this update, it is still possible for NFSv3
clients to guess valid file handles and access files outside
an exported subdirectory, unless the 'subtree_check' export
option is enabled. It is recommended that you do not use
that option but only export whole filesystem volumes.

CVE-2021-3347

It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan H.
Sch&ouml;nherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
(xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A
malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of service
(crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege escalation,
within the domain running the backend, which is typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038

backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A
malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of service
(crash) within the domain running the backend, which is typically
dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs. On a
system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information leak to
local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
properly restrict access to its netlink management interface. On a
system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to
cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
correctly limit the lengths of parameters or 'passthrough PDUs' sent
through its netlink management interface. On a system acting as an
iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the contents of
kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel memory corruption
or crash), and probably for privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.258-1.

Python 3.x has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c,

that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input. This occurs
because sprintf is used unsafely.

CVE-2021-3426

CVE-2021-23336

The Python3.5 vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via
urllib.parse.parse_qsl and urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector
called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query
parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the
interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default
configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests
being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not
see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it
in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

**Attention, API-change!** Please be sure your software is
working properly if it uses `urllib.parse.parse_qs` or
`urllib.parse.parse_qsl`, `cgi.parse` or
`cgi.parse_multipart`.

Earlier Python versions allowed using both ``;`` and ``&``
as query parameter separators in `urllib.parse.parse_qs` and
`urllib.parse.parse_qsl`. Due to security concerns, and to
conform with newer W3C recommendations, this has been
changed to allow only a single separator key, with ``&`` as

may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

This update is not yet available for the armel (ARM EABI soft-float)
architecture.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly of fragmented
packets. In some circumstances, an attacker within range of a network
could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary packets and/or to access
sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the 'is aggregated' packet
header flag. An attacker within range of a network could exploit this
to forge arbitrary packets on that network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered several reference
counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to
use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered
that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that
could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has
also been fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the
NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could exploit this for denial of
service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would
forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a FUSE
server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

&#x9A6C;&#x54F2;&#x5B87; (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the 'nosy'
driver for TI PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list
corruption and a use-after-free. On a system that uses this driver,
local users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the Bluetooth
subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or double-free. A local
user could exploit these to caue a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the SCTP
implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly of fragmented
packets. In some circumstances, an attacker within range of a network
could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary packets and/or to access
sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the 'is aggregated' packet
header flag. An attacker within range of a network could exploit this
to forge arbitrary packets on that network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered several reference
counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to
use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered
that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that
could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has
also been fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the
NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could exploit this for denial of
service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would
forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a FUSE
server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

driver for TI PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list
corruption and a use-after-free. On a system that uses this driver,
local users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the Bluetooth
subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or double-free. A local
user could exploit these to caue a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the SCTP
implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly of fragmented
packets. In some circumstances, an attacker within range of a network
could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary packets and/or to access
sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the 'is aggregated' packet
header flag. An attacker within range of a network could exploit this
to forge arbitrary packets on that network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered several reference
counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to
use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered
that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that
could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has
also been fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the
NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could exploit this for denial of
service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would
forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a FUSE
server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the SCTP
implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.272-1. This update additionally includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 4.9.259-4.9.272 inclusive.

CVE-2020-26139

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would
forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

&#x9A6C;&#x54F2;&#x5B87; (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the 'nosy'
driver for TI PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list
corruption and a use-after-free. On a system that uses this driver,
local users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the Bluetooth
subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or double-free. A local
user could exploit these to caue a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the SCTP
implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a FUSE
server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

&#x9A6C;&#x54F2;&#x5B87; (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the 'nosy'
driver for TI PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list
corruption and a use-after-free. On a system that uses this driver,
local users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the Bluetooth
subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or double-free. A local
user could exploit these to caue a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the SCTP
implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered several reference
counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to
use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered
that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that
could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has
also been fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the
NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could exploit this for denial of
service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would
forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a FUSE
server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

&#x9A6C;&#x54F2;&#x5B87; (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the 'nosy'
driver for TI PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list
corruption and a use-after-free. On a system that uses this driver,
local users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the Bluetooth
subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or double-free. A local
user could exploit these to caue a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the SCTP
implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly of fragmented
packets. In some circumstances, an attacker within range of a network
could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary packets and/or to access
sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the 'is aggregated' packet
header flag. An attacker within range of a network could exploit this
to forge arbitrary packets on that network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered several reference
counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to
use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered
that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that
could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has
also been fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the
NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could exploit this for denial of
service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would
forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a FUSE
server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

&#x9A6C;&#x54F2;&#x5B87; (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the 'nosy'
driver for TI PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list
corruption and a use-after-free. On a system that uses this driver,
local users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the Bluetooth
subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or double-free. A local
user could exploit these to caue a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the SCTP
implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly of fragmented
packets. In some circumstances, an attacker within range of a network
could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary packets and/or to access
sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the 'is aggregated' packet
header flag. An attacker within range of a network could exploit this
to forge arbitrary packets on that network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered several reference
counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to
use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered
that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that
could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has
also been fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the
NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could exploit this for denial of
service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would
forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a FUSE
server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

&#x9A6C;&#x54F2;&#x5B87; (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the 'nosy'
driver for TI PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list
corruption and a use-after-free. On a system that uses this driver,
local users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the Bluetooth
subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or double-free. A local
user could exploit these to caue a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the SCTP
implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly of fragmented
packets. In some circumstances, an attacker within range of a network
could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary packets and/or to access
sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the 'is aggregated' packet
header flag. An attacker within range of a network could exploit this
to forge arbitrary packets on that network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered several reference
counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to
use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered
that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that
could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has
also been fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the
NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could exploit this for denial of
service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would
forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a FUSE
server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

&#x9A6C;&#x54F2;&#x5B87; (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the 'nosy'
driver for TI PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list
corruption and a use-after-free. On a system that uses this driver,
local users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the Bluetooth
subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or double-free. A local
user could exploit these to caue a denial of service (crash or memory
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the SCTP
implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly of fragmented
packets. In some circumstances, an attacker within range of a network
could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary packets and/or to access
sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the 'is aggregated' packet
header flag. An attacker within range of a network could exploit this
to forge arbitrary packets on that network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered several reference
counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to
use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered
that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that
could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has
also been fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the
NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could exploit this for denial of
service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would
forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a FUSE
server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On

memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.272-1. This update additionally includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 4.9.259-4.9.272 inclusive.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly of fragmented
packets. In some circumstances, an attacker within range of a network
could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary packets and/or to access
sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations, including
Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the 'is aggregated' packet
header flag. An attacker within range of a network could exploit this
to forge arbitrary packets on that network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered several reference
counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to
use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered
that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that
could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has
also been fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

kiyin (&#x5C39;&#x4EAE;) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the
NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could exploit this for denial of
service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would
forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender was
not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network could use
this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting other
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of it. An
attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they pair using
Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the shared secret
(Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
management. A parent and child process initially share all their
memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an operation
such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an additional reference
to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs during this operation,
the kernel might have accessed the wrong process's memory. For some
programs, this could lead to an information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a FUSE
server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

The original fix for this introduced a different potential
denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has
also been fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential NULL pointer
dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user could use
this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local user
on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for
privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match driver
expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the SCTP
implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local user could
exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker within
WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)
introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest could
presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which can
lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local user
could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for Intel
PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed
'Haswell' and earlier could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On
systems with the affected CPUs, if users are permitted to access
performance events, a local user may exploit this to cause a denial of
service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users do not have access to
performance events, which mitigates this issue. This is
controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler for x86_64
generated incorrect branch instructions in some cases. On systems
where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code in the kernel.

By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.
This is controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host (server)
implementation which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. On a
system acting as a USB/IP host, a client can exploit this to cause a
denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC Router
(qrtr) implementation.

This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem could
lead to a NULL pointer dereference during replacement of a table. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

By default, unprivileged users cannot create user
namespaces, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled
by the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access video
devices (by default, any member of the 'video' group) could exploit
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (i.e.
root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not have any
security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead
to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a
    buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings
    which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not
    a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar
    parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will
    additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for
    applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array
    by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using
    the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to
    assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for
    strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be
    printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the
    application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing
    can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been
    directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the
    certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the
    X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an
    application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL
    functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).
    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive
    plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected
    1.0.2-1.0.2y). (CVE-2021-3712)

advisory.

  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a
    buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings
    which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not
    a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar
    parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will
    additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for
    applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array
    by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using
    the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to
    assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for
    strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be
    printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the
    application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing
    can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been
    directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the
    certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the
    X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an
    application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL
    functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).
    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive
    plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected
    1.0.2-1.0.2y). (CVE-2021-3712)

  - nghttp2 version >= 1.10.0 and nghttp2 <= v1.31.0 contains an Improper Input Validation CWE-20

  - In unix_scm_to_skb of af_unix.c, there is a possible use after free bug due to a race condition. This
    could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is
    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References:
    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's joystick devices subsystem in versions
    before 5.9-rc1, in the way the user calls ioctl JSIOCSBTNMAP. This flaw allows a local user to crash the
    system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3612)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on
    inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2021-3655)

  - A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was
    found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.
    (CVE-2021-3679)

  - hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev
    without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free.
    (CVE-2021-37159)

  - ** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss
    can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE:
    the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case; the
    length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.
    (CVE-2021-38160)

  - arch/x86/kvm/mmu/paging_tmpl.h in the Linux kernel before 5.12.11 incorrectly computes the access
    permissions of a shadow page, leading to a missing guest protection page fault. (CVE-2021-38198)

  - fs/nfs/nfs4client.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 has incorrect connection-setup ordering, which
    allows operators of remote NFSv4 servers to cause a denial of service (hanging of mounts) by arranging for
    those servers to be unreachable during trunking detection. (CVE-2021-38199)

  - inflect is vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CVE-2021-3820)

  - drivers/usb/host/max3421-hcd.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.6 allows physically proximate attackers to
    cause a denial of service (use-after-free and panic) by removing a MAX-3421 USB device in certain
    situations. (CVE-2021-38204)

  - drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3 makes it easier for
    attackers to defeat an ASLR protection mechanism because it prints a kernel pointer (i.e., the real IOMEM
    pointer). (CVE-2021-38205)

  - A race condition was discovered in ext4_write_inline_data_end in fs/ext4/inline.c in the ext4 subsystem in
    the Linux kernel through 5.13.13. (CVE-2021-40490)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel through 5.14.9 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The decode_data function in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.13 has a slab
    out-of-bounds write. Input from a process that has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can lead to root access.
    (CVE-2021-42008)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References:
    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's joystick devices subsystem in versions
    before 5.9-rc1, in the way the user calls ioctl JSIOCSBTNMAP. This flaw allows a local user to crash the
    system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3612)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on
    inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2021-3655)

  - A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was
    found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.
    (CVE-2021-3679)

  - hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev
    without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free.
    (CVE-2021-37159)

  - ** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss
    can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE:
    the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case; the
    length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.
    (CVE-2021-38160)

  - arch/x86/kvm/mmu/paging_tmpl.h in the Linux kernel before 5.12.11 incorrectly computes the access
    permissions of a shadow page, leading to a missing guest protection page fault. (CVE-2021-38198)

  - fs/nfs/nfs4client.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 has incorrect connection-setup ordering, which
    allows operators of remote NFSv4 servers to cause a denial of service (hanging of mounts) by arranging for
    those servers to be unreachable during trunking detection. (CVE-2021-38199)

  - inflect is vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CVE-2021-3820)

  - drivers/usb/host/max3421-hcd.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.6 allows physically proximate attackers to
    cause a denial of service (use-after-free and panic) by removing a MAX-3421 USB device in certain
    situations. (CVE-2021-38204)

  - drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3 makes it easier for
    attackers to defeat an ASLR protection mechanism because it prints a kernel pointer (i.e., the real IOMEM
    pointer). (CVE-2021-38205)

  - A race condition was discovered in ext4_write_inline_data_end in fs/ext4/inline.c in the ext4 subsystem in
    the Linux kernel through 5.13.13. (CVE-2021-40490)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel through 5.14.9 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The decode_data function in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.13 has a slab
    out-of-bounds write. Input from a process that has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can lead to root access.
    (CVE-2021-42008)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References:
    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's joystick devices subsystem in versions
    before 5.9-rc1, in the way the user calls ioctl JSIOCSBTNMAP. This flaw allows a local user to crash the
    system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3612)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on
    inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2021-3655)

  - A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was
    found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.

  - hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev

    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References:
    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's joystick devices subsystem in versions
    before 5.9-rc1, in the way the user calls ioctl JSIOCSBTNMAP. This flaw allows a local user to crash the
    system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3612)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on
    inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2021-3655)

  - A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was
    found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.
    (CVE-2021-3679)

  - hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev
    without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free.
    (CVE-2021-37159)

  - ** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss
    can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE:
    the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case; the
    length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.
    (CVE-2021-38160)

  - arch/x86/kvm/mmu/paging_tmpl.h in the Linux kernel before 5.12.11 incorrectly computes the access
    permissions of a shadow page, leading to a missing guest protection page fault. (CVE-2021-38198)

  - fs/nfs/nfs4client.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 has incorrect connection-setup ordering, which
    allows operators of remote NFSv4 servers to cause a denial of service (hanging of mounts) by arranging for
    those servers to be unreachable during trunking detection. (CVE-2021-38199)

  - inflect is vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CVE-2021-3820)

  - drivers/usb/host/max3421-hcd.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.6 allows physically proximate attackers to
    cause a denial of service (use-after-free and panic) by removing a MAX-3421 USB device in certain

    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local

    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3612)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on

    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's joystick devices subsystem in versions
    before 5.9-rc1, in the way the user calls ioctl JSIOCSBTNMAP. This flaw allows a local user to crash the
    system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3612)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on
    inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2021-3655)

  - A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was
    found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.
    (CVE-2021-3679)

  - hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev
    without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free.
    (CVE-2021-37159)

  - ** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss
    can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE:
    the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case; the
    length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.
    (CVE-2021-38160)

  - arch/x86/kvm/mmu/paging_tmpl.h in the Linux kernel before 5.12.11 incorrectly computes the access
    permissions of a shadow page, leading to a missing guest protection page fault. (CVE-2021-38198)

  - fs/nfs/nfs4client.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 has incorrect connection-setup ordering, which
    allows operators of remote NFSv4 servers to cause a denial of service (hanging of mounts) by arranging for
    those servers to be unreachable during trunking detection. (CVE-2021-38199)

  - inflect is vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CVE-2021-3820)

  - drivers/usb/host/max3421-hcd.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.6 allows physically proximate attackers to
    cause a denial of service (use-after-free and panic) by removing a MAX-3421 USB device in certain
    situations. (CVE-2021-38204)

  - drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3 makes it easier for
    attackers to defeat an ASLR protection mechanism because it prints a kernel pointer (i.e., the real IOMEM
    pointer). (CVE-2021-38205)

    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's joystick devices subsystem in versions
    before 5.9-rc1, in the way the user calls ioctl JSIOCSBTNMAP. This flaw allows a local user to crash the
    system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3612)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on
    inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2021-3655)

  - A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was
    found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.
    (CVE-2021-3679)

  - hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev
    without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free.
    (CVE-2021-37159)

  - ** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss
    can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE:
    the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case; the
    length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.
    (CVE-2021-38160)

  - arch/x86/kvm/mmu/paging_tmpl.h in the Linux kernel before 5.12.11 incorrectly computes the access
    permissions of a shadow page, leading to a missing guest protection page fault. (CVE-2021-38198)

  - fs/nfs/nfs4client.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 has incorrect connection-setup ordering, which
    allows operators of remote NFSv4 servers to cause a denial of service (hanging of mounts) by arranging for
    those servers to be unreachable during trunking detection. (CVE-2021-38199)

  - inflect is vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CVE-2021-3820)

  - drivers/usb/host/max3421-hcd.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.6 allows physically proximate attackers to
    cause a denial of service (use-after-free and panic) by removing a MAX-3421 USB device in certain
    situations. (CVE-2021-38204)

  - drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3 makes it easier for
    attackers to defeat an ASLR protection mechanism because it prints a kernel pointer (i.e., the real IOMEM
    pointer). (CVE-2021-38205)

  - A race condition was discovered in ext4_write_inline_data_end in fs/ext4/inline.c in the ext4 subsystem in
    the Linux kernel through 5.13.13. (CVE-2021-40490)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel through 5.14.9 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The decode_data function in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.13 has a slab
    out-of-bounds write. Input from a process that has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can lead to root access.
    (CVE-2021-42008)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

    could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is
    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References:
    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's joystick devices subsystem in versions
    before 5.9-rc1, in the way the user calls ioctl JSIOCSBTNMAP. This flaw allows a local user to crash the
    system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3612)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on
    inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2021-3655)

  - A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was
    found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.
    (CVE-2021-3679)

  - hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev
    without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free.
    (CVE-2021-37159)

  - ** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss
    can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE:
    the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case; the
    length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.
    (CVE-2021-38160)

  - arch/x86/kvm/mmu/paging_tmpl.h in the Linux kernel before 5.12.11 incorrectly computes the access
    permissions of a shadow page, leading to a missing guest protection page fault. (CVE-2021-38198)

  - fs/nfs/nfs4client.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 has incorrect connection-setup ordering, which
    allows operators of remote NFSv4 servers to cause a denial of service (hanging of mounts) by arranging for
    those servers to be unreachable during trunking detection. (CVE-2021-38199)

  - inflect is vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CVE-2021-3820)

  - drivers/usb/host/max3421-hcd.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.6 allows physically proximate attackers to
    cause a denial of service (use-after-free and panic) by removing a MAX-3421 USB device in certain
    situations. (CVE-2021-38204)

  - drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3 makes it easier for
    attackers to defeat an ASLR protection mechanism because it prints a kernel pointer (i.e., the real IOMEM
    pointer). (CVE-2021-38205)

  - A race condition was discovered in ext4_write_inline_data_end in fs/ext4/inline.c in the ext4 subsystem in
    the Linux kernel through 5.13.13. (CVE-2021-40490)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel through 5.14.9 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The decode_data function in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.13 has a slab
    out-of-bounds write. Input from a process that has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can lead to root access.
    (CVE-2021-42008)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on

    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's joystick devices subsystem in versions
    before 5.9-rc1, in the way the user calls ioctl JSIOCSBTNMAP. This flaw allows a local user to crash the
    system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3612)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on
    inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2021-3655)

  - A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was
    found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.
    (CVE-2021-3679)

  - hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev
    without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free.
    (CVE-2021-37159)

  - ** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss
    can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE:
    the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case; the
    length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.
    (CVE-2021-38160)

  - arch/x86/kvm/mmu/paging_tmpl.h in the Linux kernel before 5.12.11 incorrectly computes the access
    permissions of a shadow page, leading to a missing guest protection page fault. (CVE-2021-38198)

  - fs/nfs/nfs4client.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 has incorrect connection-setup ordering, which
    allows operators of remote NFSv4 servers to cause a denial of service (hanging of mounts) by arranging for
    those servers to be unreachable during trunking detection. (CVE-2021-38199)

  - inflect is vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CVE-2021-3820)

  - drivers/usb/host/max3421-hcd.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.6 allows physically proximate attackers to
    cause a denial of service (use-after-free and panic) by removing a MAX-3421 USB device in certain
    situations. (CVE-2021-38204)

  - drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3 makes it easier for
    attackers to defeat an ASLR protection mechanism because it prints a kernel pointer (i.e., the real IOMEM
    pointer). (CVE-2021-38205)

  - A race condition was discovered in ext4_write_inline_data_end in fs/ext4/inline.c in the ext4 subsystem in
    the Linux kernel through 5.13.13. (CVE-2021-40490)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel through 5.14.9 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The decode_data function in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.13 has a slab
    out-of-bounds write. Input from a process that has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can lead to root access.
    (CVE-2021-42008)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on
    inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2021-3655)

  - A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was
    found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.

  - fs/nfs/nfs4client.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 has incorrect connection-setup ordering, which
    allows operators of remote NFSv4 servers to cause a denial of service (hanging of mounts) by arranging for
    those servers to be unreachable during trunking detection. (CVE-2021-38199)

  - inflect is vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CVE-2021-3820)

  - drivers/usb/host/max3421-hcd.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.6 allows physically proximate attackers to
    cause a denial of service (use-after-free and panic) by removing a MAX-3421 USB device in certain

  - The decode_data function in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.13 has a slab
    out-of-bounds write. Input from a process that has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can lead to root access.
    (CVE-2021-42008)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local

    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3612)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak

  - A crafted URI sent to httpd configured as a forward proxy (ProxyRequests on) can cause a crash (NULL
    pointer dereference) or, for configurations mixing forward and reverse proxy declarations, can allow for
    requests to be directed to a declared Unix Domain Socket endpoint (Server Side Request Forgery). This
    issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.7 up to 2.4.51 (included). (CVE-2021-44224)

  - A carefully crafted request body can cause a buffer overflow in the mod_lua multipart parser
    (r:parsebody() called from Lua scripts). The Apache httpd team is not aware of an exploit for the
    vulnerability though it might be possible to craft one. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 and

dla-2952 advisory.

  - There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit
    moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime
    RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed
    likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have
    to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low
    level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t). (CVE-2019-1551)

  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop
    forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain
    elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point
    encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has
    invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the
    certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a
    denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they
    can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients
    consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking
    certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from
    subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that
    use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS
    issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate
    which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the
    public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-
    signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue
    affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the
    15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)

  - A denial of service vulnerability was found in rsyslog in the imptcp module. An attacker could send a
    specially crafted message to the imptcp socket, which would cause rsyslog to crash. Versions before 8.27.0
    are vulnerable. (CVE-2018-16881)

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap
    buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other
    malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But
    there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the
    octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence
    of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote
    exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing
    modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,
    `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to
    directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module
    `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present
    on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be
    specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important
    modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation. CVE-2022-1199 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 hamradio
    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can
    receive a netlink message when an IPsec daemon registers with the kernel, and this could include sensitive
    information. CVE-2022-1516 A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25 set of
    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not
    enabled in Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1974 , CVE-2022-1975 Duoming Zhou discovered
    that the NFC netlink interface was suspectible to denial of service. CVE-2022-2153 kangel reported a flaw
    in the KVM implementation for x86 processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local user
    permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash). CVE-2022-21123 ,
    CVE-2022-21125, CVE-2022-21166 Various researchers discovered flaws in Intel x86 processors, collectively
    referred to as MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities. These are similar to the previously published
    Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) issues and could be exploited by local users to leak sensitive
    information. For some CPUs, the mitigations for these issues require updated microcode. An updated intel-
    microcode package may be provided at a later date. The updated CPU microcode may also be available as part
    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a
    way that could be exploited by a malicious device backend to cause data corruption, leaks of sensitive
    information, or a denial of service (crash). CVE-2022-23960 Researchers at VUSec discovered that the
    Branch History Buffer in Arm processors can be exploited to create information side channels with
    speculative execution. This issue is similar to Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on
    some processors. This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a different security context,
    such as from user-space to the kernel, or from a KVM guest to the kernel. CVE-2022-24958 A flaw was
    discovered that the USB gadget subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to
    configure USB gadgets could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-26490 Buffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core
    driver can result in denial of service or privilege escalation. This driver is not enabled in Debian's
    official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-26966 A flaw was discovered in the sr9700 USB networking driver.
    A local user able to attach a specially designed USB device could use this to leak sensitive information.
    CVE-2022-27223 A flaw was discovered in the udc-xilinx USB gadget-mode controller driver. On systems using
    this driver, a malicious USB host could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute arbitrary code. This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-
    free in Netfilter which may result in local privilege escalation to root. CVE-2022-33981 Yuan Ming from
    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an

    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for

    some processors. This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a different security context,
    such as from user-space to the kernel, or from a KVM guest to the kernel. CVE-2022-24958 A flaw was
    discovered that the USB gadget subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to
    configure USB gadgets could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-26490 Buffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core
    driver can result in denial of service or privilege escalation. This driver is not enabled in Debian's
    official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-26966 A flaw was discovered in the sr9700 USB networking driver.
    A local user able to attach a specially designed USB device could use this to leak sensitive information.
    CVE-2022-27223 A flaw was discovered in the udc-xilinx USB gadget-mode controller driver. On systems using
    this driver, a malicious USB host could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute arbitrary code. This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-
    free in Netfilter which may result in local privilege escalation to root. CVE-2022-33981 Yuan Ming from
    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an

    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an

    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an

    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an

    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an

    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    information. CVE-2022-1516 A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25 set of
    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    information. CVE-2022-1516 A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25 set of
    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    information. CVE-2022-1516 A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25 set of
    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    information. CVE-2022-1516 A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25 set of
    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    information. CVE-2022-1516 A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25 set of
    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    information. CVE-2022-1516 A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25 set of
    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    information. CVE-2022-1516 A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25 set of
    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not

    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a

    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-

    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom

dla-3065 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation,
    denial of service or information leaks. This update is unfortunately not available for the armel
    architecture. CVE-2018-1108 It was discovered that the random driver could generate random bytes through
    /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before gathering enough entropy that these would be
    unpredictable. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. The
    original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems.
    In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without
    needing a hardware RNG. CVE-2021-4149 Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There is a
    potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user might be able to exploit this for denial of
    service. CVE-2021-39713 The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which
    could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-0494 The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an
    information leak only exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. CVE-2022-0812
    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma) miscalculated the size of message headers,
    which could lead to a leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients. CVE-2022-0854 Ali
    Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature
    is needed, this might allow a local user to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1011 Jann Horn discovered
    a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1012 ,
    CVE-2022-32296 Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness in randomisation of TCP source
    port selection. CVE-2022-1016 David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that nf_tables expressions can read from and write
    to. A local attacker can take advantage of this to read sensitive information. CVE-2022-1198 Duoming Zhou
    discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for

    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference. A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    CVE-2022-1353 The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY subsystem. A local user can

    information. CVE-2022-1516 A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25 set of
    standardized network protocols, which can result in denial of service. This driver is not enabled in
    Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1729 Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the
    perf subsystem which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The default settings in Debian
    prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
    sysctl. CVE-2022-1734 Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver that could lead to
    a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This driver is not
    enabled in Debian's official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-1974 , CVE-2022-1975 Duoming Zhou discovered

    of a system firmware (BIOS) update. Further information on the mitigation can be found at or in the
    linux-doc-4.9 package. CVE-2022-23036 , CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040,
    CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396) Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers misused the Xen grant table API in a

    such as from user-space to the kernel, or from a KVM guest to the kernel. CVE-2022-24958 A flaw was
    discovered that the USB gadget subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to
    configure USB gadgets could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation. CVE-2022-26490 Buffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core
    driver can result in denial of service or privilege escalation. This driver is not enabled in Debian's
    official kernel configurations. CVE-2022-26966 A flaw was discovered in the sr9700 USB networking driver.
    A local user able to attach a specially designed USB device could use this to leak sensitive information.
    CVE-2022-27223 A flaw was discovered in the udc-xilinx USB gadget-mode controller driver. On systems using
    this driver, a malicious USB host could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute arbitrary code. This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations. CVE-2022-28356 Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did not
    properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A local attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service. CVE-2022-28390 A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-
    USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface driver. CVE-2022-30594 Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between
    ptrace and seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still permitted to use ptrace()
    could exploit this to remove the seccomp restrictions. CVE-2022-32250 Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-
    free in Netfilter which may result in local privilege escalation to root. CVE-2022-33981 Yuan Ming from
    Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl,
    which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy drive device could exploit this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. This ioctl
    is now disabled by default. For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.320-2. For
    the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
    algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to a leak of
    sensitive information. This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.304-4.9.320
    inclusive. The random driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and
    correctness issues. Some changes will be visible: - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.
    You may need to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space entropy gathering services to
    allow for this. - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more uses of /dev/urandom
    before it is fully initialised. These uses were previously under-counted and this is not a regression. We
    recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. For the detailed security status of linux please refer to
    its security tracker page at: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux Further information about
    Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply these updates to your system and frequently asked questions
    can be found at: https://wiki.debian.org/LTS
