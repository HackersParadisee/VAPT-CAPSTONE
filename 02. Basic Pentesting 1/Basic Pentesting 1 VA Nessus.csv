    It was discovered that the Flash-Friendly File System (f2fs) implementation in the Linux kernel did not
    properly validate superblock metadata. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
    (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10663)

    Anthony Perard discovered that the Xen virtual block driver did not properly initialize some data
    structures before passing them to user space. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose
    sensitive information from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2017-10911)

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","
