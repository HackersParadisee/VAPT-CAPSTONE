protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH

  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB

It is likely that this condition is caused by one or more of the
following:

1)  A plugin tried to access a resource that requires a special
    privilege level such as NT_AUTHORITY on Windows.  The resource
    may have had its permissions altered since the plugin was
    written.
2)  Environmental issues may have caused an intermittent failure
    in authentication that caused Nessus to stop attempting
    privilege escalation.
3)  A resource on the host that Nessus attempts to access multiple
    times may be configured with access limits.  Related lockouts may
    look like permissions failures.
4)  Nessus may have tried to access a resource that does not exist
    on a target that fails to properly report permissions issues.
    For instance, on some legacy unix systems such as AIX or HP-UX
    there is no way to distinguish a missing resource from a
    permissions error.

wrong resource or a resource that has recently received special OS
