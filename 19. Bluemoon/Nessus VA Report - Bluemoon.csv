an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","

    before it resolves it, potentially leaking the partial
    password over the network and to the DNS server(s).

  - CVE-2020-8177
    sn reported that curl could be tricked by a malicious
    server into overwriting a local file when using the -J
    (--remote-header-name) and -i (--include) options in the
    same command line.

  - CVE-2020-8231
    Marc Aldorasi reported that libcurl might use the wrong

    sets the option CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY, which could lead
    to information leaks.

  - CVE-2020-8284

    could use the PASV response to trick curl into
    connecting back to an arbitrary IP address and port,
    potentially making curl extract information about

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.","Upgrade the linux packages.","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=988044

    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows

    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file

    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file

    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file

    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.","Upgrade the linux packages.","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=988044

    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.","Upgrade the linux packages.","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=988044

    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the

dsa-5096 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The
    get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider
    the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.
    (CVE-2020-29374)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the
    timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user
    privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
    (CVE-2021-20317)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux
    kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an
    off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
    port randomization are indirectly affected as well. (CVE-2021-20322)

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record
    relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is
    ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can
    be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming
    new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
    Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.
    (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
    its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case
    when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714) (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A stall on CPU can occur
    because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. (CVE-2021-28950)

  - A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the
    way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del()
    together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A
    privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    (CVE-2021-3640)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).
    This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. (CVE-2021-3744)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat
    to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when
    transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context.
    This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.
    (CVE-2021-38300)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows
    unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds
    write. (CVE-2021-41864)

  - The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to
    drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt
    mishandles bounds checking. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in
    the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. (CVE-2021-43389)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a
    crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. (CVE-2021-43975)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.
    (CVE-2021-45095)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances.
    (CVE-2021-45480)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in
    drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. (CVE-2022-24959)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

advisory.

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap
    buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other
    malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But
    there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the
    octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence
    of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote
    exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing
    modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,
    `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to
    directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module
    `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present
    on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be
    specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important
    modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

  - In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances
    where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection
    were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other
    places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command
    executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is
    automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the

    Debian Bug     : 989228 991492 1010295 1010254 1010253 1010252

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
    library. These flaws may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
    information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a
    denial of service attack.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    7.64.0-4+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2795 CVE-2022-38177 CVE-2022-38178

    Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server
    implementation.

    CVE-2022-2795

        Yehuda Afek, Anat Bremler-Barr and Shani Stajnrod discovered that a
        flaw in the resolver code can cause named to spend excessive amounts
        of time on processing large delegations, significantly degrade
        resolver performance and result in denial of service.

    CVE-2022-38177

        It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA
        algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker
        can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,
        resulting in a denial of service.

    CVE-2022-38178

        It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA
        algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker
        can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,
        resulting in a denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u8.

    Debian Bug     : 985120

    Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Git, a fast, scalable,
    distributed revision control system, which may affect multi-user systems.

    CVE-2021-21300

        A specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as
        files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may cause just-checked
        out script to be executed while cloning onto a case-insensitive file system
        such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the default file systems on Windows and
        macOS).

    CVE-2021-40330

        git_connect_git in connect.c allows a repository path to contain a newline
        character, which may result in unexpected cross-protocol requests, as
        demonstrated by the git://localhost:1234/%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/%20HTTP/1.1
        substring.


    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

    CVE ID         : CVE-2021-21300 CVE-2021-40330
    Debian Bug     : 985120

    Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Git, a fast, scalable,
    distributed revision control system, which may affect multi-user systems.

    CVE-2021-21300

        A specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as
        files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may cause just-checked
        out script to be executed while cloning onto a case-insensitive file system
        such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the default file systems on Windows and
        macOS).

    CVE-2021-40330

        git_connect_git in connect.c allows a repository path to contain a newline
        character, which may result in unexpected cross-protocol requests, as
        demonstrated by the git://localhost:1234/%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/%20HTTP/1.1
        substring.


    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:2.20.1-2+deb10u4.

    We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.

                     983479 989147 990542

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

                     983479 989147 990542

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,

                     983479 989147 990542

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.


    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range

                     983479 989147 990542

    This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
    affects character set conversion.

    CVE-2016-10228

        The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
        suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
        the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

    CVE-2019-19126

        On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
        LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
        execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
        restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
        thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

    CVE-2019-25013

        The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
        over-read.

    CVE-2020-10029

        The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
        reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
        non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
        0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
        to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

    CVE-2020-1752

        A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
        way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
        an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
        issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
        specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
        would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2020-27618

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
        and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
        lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
        service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

    CVE-2020-6096

        An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
        targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
        value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
        vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
        memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
        writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
        program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
        or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
        execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
        corrupted data.

    CVE-2021-27645

        The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
        processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
        double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
        Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

    CVE-2021-3326

        The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
        input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
        the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
        denial of service.

    CVE-2021-33574

        The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
        may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
        its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
        leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
        unspecified other impact.

    CVE-2021-35942

        The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
        memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
        untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
        service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
        used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

    CVE-2021-3999

        An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
        memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
        attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
        in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
        arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

    CVE-2022-23218

        The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
        module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
        without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
        is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    CVE-2022-23219

        The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
        of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
        validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
        potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
        not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

    Debian Bug     : 1022224 1022225

    It was discovered that libxml2, the GNOME XML library, was vulnerable to
    integer overflows and memory corruption.

    CVE-2022-40303

         Parsing a XML document with the XML_PARSE_HUGE option enabled can result
         in an integer overflow because safety checks were missing in some
         functions. Also, the xmlParseEntityValue function did not have any length
         limitation.

    CVE-2022-40304

         When a reference cycle is detected in the XML entity cleanup function the
         XML entity data can be stored in a dictionary. In this case, the
         dictionary becomes corrupted resulting in logic errors, including memory
         errors like double free.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    For the detailed security status of vim please refer to

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    For the detailed security status of vim please refer to
    its security tracker page at:

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
    vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
    a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

    Version        : 2.06-3~deb10u2
    CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2601 CVE-2022-3775

    Several issues were found in GRUB2's font handling code, which could
    result in crashes and potentially execution of arbitrary code. These
    could lead to by-pass of UEFI Secure Boot on affected systems.

    Further, issues were found in image loading that could potentially
    lead to memory overflows.

Please see https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/SettingsAdvanced.htm#Custom for more information.

Note: This plugin leverages the '-maxdepth' find command option, which is a feature implemented by
the GNU find binary. If the target does not support this option, such as HP-UX and AIX devices,
users will need to enable 'thorough tests' in their scan policy to run the find command without
using a '-maxdepth' argument.","n/a","https://openssl.org/","

    Debian Bug     : 1024267

    It was discovered that there was a potential Denial of Service (DoS)
    attack against krb5, a suite of tools implementing the Kerberos
    authentication system. An integer overflow in PAC parsing could have
    been exploited if a cross-realm entity acted maliciously.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version

    Package        : git
    Version        : 1:2.20.1-2+deb10u6

    In rare conditions, the previous git update released as DLA-3239-1
    could generate a segmentation fault, which prevented its availability
    on armhf architecture. This update addresses this issue. For reference
    the original advisory text follows.

    Multiple issues were found in Git, a distributed revision control
    system. An attacker may cause other local users into executing
    arbitrary commands, leak information from the local filesystem, and
    bypass restricted shell.

    Note: Due to new security checks, access to repositories owned and
    accessed by different local users may now be rejected by Git; in case
    changing ownership is not practical, git displays a way to bypass
    these checks using the new 'safe.directory' configuration entry.

    CVE-2022-24765

        Git is not checking the ownership of directories in a local
        multi-user system when running commands specified in the local
        repository configuration.  This allows the owner of the repository
        to cause arbitrary commands to be executed by other users who
        access the repository.

    CVE-2022-29187

        An unsuspecting user could still be affected by the issue reported
        in CVE-2022-24765, for example when navigating as root into a
        shared tmp directory that is owned by them, but where an attacker
        could create a git repository.

    CVE-2022-39253

        Exposure of sensitive information to a malicious actor. When
        performing a local clone (where the source and target of the clone
        are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source's
        `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either
        creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if
        hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor
        could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link
        pointing at sensitive information on the victim's machine.

    CVE-2022-39260

        `git shell` improperly uses an `int` to represent the number of
        entries in the array, allowing a malicious actor to intentionally
        overflow the return value, leading to arbitrary heap
        writes. Because the resulting array is then passed to `execv()`,
        it is possible to leverage this attack to gain remote code
        execution on a victim machine.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    1:2.20.1-2+deb10u6.

        it is possible to leverage this attack to gain remote code
        execution on a victim machine.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-22809


    Matthieu Barjole and Victor Cutillas discovered that sudoedit in sudo, a
    program designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific
    users, does not properly handle '--' to separate the editor and arguments
    from files to edit. A local user permitted to edit certain files can take
    advantage of this flaw to edit a file not permitted by the security
    policy, resulting in privilege escalation.

    Package        : git
    Version        : 1:2.20.1-2+deb10u7
    CVE ID         : CVE-2022-23521 CVE-2022-41903
    Debian Bug     : 1029114

    Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Git, a distributed revision
    control system. An attacker may trigger code execution in specific
    situations.

    CVE-2022-23521

        gitattributes are a mechanism to allow defining attributes for
        paths. These attributes can be defined by adding a
        `.gitattributes` file to the repository, which contains a set of
        file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths
        matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes, multiple
        integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path
        patterns, a huge number of attributes for a single pattern, or
        when the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows can be
        triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of
        the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when
        parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from
        the index. Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether
        the file exists in the working tree, the index or both. This
        integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes,
        which may result in remote code execution.

    CVE-2022-41903

        `git log` can display commits in an arbitrary format using its
        `--format` specifiers. This functionality is also exposed to `git
        archive` via the `export-subst` gitattribute. When processing the
        padding operators, there is a integer overflow in
        `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored
        improperly as an `int`, and then added as an offset to a
        `memcpy()`. This overflow can be triggered directly by a user
        running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery
        (e.g., `git log --format=...`). It may also be triggered
        indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism,
        which expands format specifiers inside of files within the
        repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result
        in arbitrary heap writes, which may result in arbitrary code
        execution.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:2.20.1-2+deb10u7.

                     CVE-2023-0767

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in nss, the Network
    Security Service libraries.

    CVE-2020-6829

        When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point
        multiplication algorithm was used; which leaked partial information about
        the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace
        of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed.

    CVE-2020-12400

        When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular
        inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible
        timing-based side channel attack.

    CVE-2020-12401

        During ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to
        ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in
        variable-time execution dependent on secret data.

    CVE-2020-12403

        A flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS.
        When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads.
        This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20
        (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length.

    CVE-2023-0767

        Christian Holler discovered that incorrect handling of PKCS 12 Safe Bag
        attributes may result in execution of arbitrary code if a specially crafted
        PKCS 12 certificate bundle is processed.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2:3.42.1-1+deb10u6.

    We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.

                     CVE-2022-37436

    Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache HTTP
    server.

    CVE-2006-20001

    A carefully crafted If: request header can cause a memory read, or write
    of a single zero byte, in a pool (heap) memory location beyond the header
    value sent. This could cause the process to crash.

    CVE-2021-33193

    A crafted method sent through HTTP/2 will bypass validation and be
    forwarded by mod_proxy, which can lead to request splitting or cache
    poisoning.

    CVE-2022-36760

    Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')
    vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to
    smuggle requests to the AJP server it forwards requests to.

    CVE-2022-37436

    A malicious backend can cause the response headers to be truncated early,
    resulting in some headers being incorporated into the response body. If
    the later headers have any security purpose, they will not be interpreted
    by the client.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

    Debian Bug     : 1011954

    Multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities were found in pcre2, a Perl
    Compatible Regular Expression library, which could result in information
    disclosure or denial or service.

    CVE-2019-20454

        Out-of-bounds read when the pattern \X is JIT compiled and used to
        match specially crafted subjects in non-UTF mode.

    CVE-2022-1586

        Out-of-bounds read involving unicode property matching in
        JIT-compiled regular expressions. The issue occurs because the
        character was not fully read in case-less matching within JIT.

    CVE-2022-1587

        Out-of-bounds read affecting recursions in JIT-compiled regular
        expressions caused by duplicate data transfers.

    This upload also fixes a subject buffer overread in JIT when UTF is
    disabled and \X or \R has a greater than 1 fixed quantifier. This issue
    was found by Yunho Kim.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    10.32-5+deb10u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your pcre2 packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1011954

    Multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities were found in pcre2, a Perl
    Compatible Regular Expression library, which could result in information
    disclosure or denial or service.

    CVE-2019-20454

        Out-of-bounds read when the pattern \X is JIT compiled and used to
        match specially crafted subjects in non-UTF mode.

    CVE-2022-1586

        Out-of-bounds read involving unicode property matching in
        JIT-compiled regular expressions. The issue occurs because the
        character was not fully read in case-less matching within JIT.

    CVE-2022-1587

        Out-of-bounds read affecting recursions in JIT-compiled regular
        expressions caused by duplicate data transfers.

    This upload also fixes a subject buffer overread in JIT when UTF is
    disabled and \X or \R has a greater than 1 fixed quantifier. This issue
    was found by Yunho Kim.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    10.32-5+deb10u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your pcre2 packages.

                     CVE-2023-27561
    Debian Bug     : 942026 988768

    Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in runc, the Open Container
    Project runtime, which is often used with virtualization environments
    such as Docker. Malicious Docker images or OCI bundles could breach
    isolation.

    CVE-2019-16884

        runc, as used in Docker and other products, allows AppArmor and
        SELinux restriction bypass because libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go
        incorrectly checks mount targets, and thus a malicious Docker
        image can mount over a /proc directory.

    CVE-2019-19921

        runc has Incorrect Access Control leading to Escalation of
        Privileges, related to libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go. To exploit
        this, an attacker must be able to spawn two containers with custom
        volume-mount configurations, and be able to run custom
        images. (This vulnerability does not affect Docker due to an
        implementation detail that happens to block the attack.)

    CVE-2021-30465

        runc allows a Container Filesystem Breakout via Directory
        Traversal. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able
        to create multiple containers with a fairly specific mount
        configuration. The problem occurs via a symlink-exchange attack
        that relies on a race condition.

    CVE-2022-29162

        `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable
        Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment
        and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to
        elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during
        execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox
        as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were
        included in the container's bounding set.

    CVE-2023-27561

        CVE-2019-19921 was re-introduced by the fix for CVE-2021-30465.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    1.0.0~rc6+dfsg1-3+deb10u2.

    We recommend that you upgrade your runc packages.

    CVE-2019-19921

        runc has Incorrect Access Control leading to Escalation of
        Privileges, related to libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go. To exploit
        this, an attacker must be able to spawn two containers with custom
        volume-mount configurations, and be able to run custom
        images. (This vulnerability does not affect Docker due to an
        implementation detail that happens to block the attack.)

    CVE-2021-30465

        runc allows a Container Filesystem Breakout via Directory
        Traversal. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able
        to create multiple containers with a fairly specific mount
        configuration. The problem occurs via a symlink-exchange attack
        that relies on a race condition.

    CVE-2022-29162

        `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable
        Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment
        and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to
        elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during
        execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox
        as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were
        included in the container's bounding set.

    Debian Bug     : 942026 988768

    Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in runc, the Open Container
    Project runtime, which is often used with virtualization environments
    such as Docker. Malicious Docker images or OCI bundles could breach
    isolation.

    CVE-2019-16884

        runc, as used in Docker and other products, allows AppArmor and
        SELinux restriction bypass because libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go
        incorrectly checks mount targets, and thus a malicious Docker
        image can mount over a /proc directory.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-27533 CVE-2023-27535 CVE-2023-27536 CVE-2023-27538

    Several security vulnerabilities have been found in cURL, an easy-to-use
    client-side URL transfer library.

    CVE-2023-27533

        A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl during
        communication using the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on
        maliciously crafted user name and telnet options during server
        negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send
        content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent.
        This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input,
        thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.

    CVE-2023-27535

        An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the FTP
        connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used
        during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in a
        connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain
        FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,
        CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the
        configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could
        lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer,
        potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

    CVE-2023-27536

        An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the
        connection reuse feature which can reuse previously established connections
        with incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for changes in
        the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability affects
        krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and could potentially result in
        unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option is to not
        reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed.

    CVE-2023-27538

        An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl where it
        reuses a previously established SSH connection despite the fact that an SSH
        option was modified, which should have prevented reuse. libcurl maintains a
        pool of previously used connections to reuse them for subsequent transfers
        if the configurations match. However, two SSH settings were omitted from
        the configuration check, allowing them to match easily, potentially leading
        to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    7.64.0-4+deb10u6.

    We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

    Package        : curl
    Version        : 7.64.0-4+deb10u6
    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-27533 CVE-2023-27535 CVE-2023-27536 CVE-2023-27538

    Several security vulnerabilities have been found in cURL, an easy-to-use
    client-side URL transfer library.

    CVE-2023-27533

        A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl during
        communication using the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on
        maliciously crafted user name and telnet options during server
        negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send
        content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent.
        This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input,
        thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.

    CVE-2023-27535

        An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the FTP
        connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used
        during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in a
        connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain
        FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,
        CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the
        configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could
        lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer,
        potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

    CVE-2023-27536

        An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the
        connection reuse feature which can reuse previously established connections
        with incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for changes in
        the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability affects
        krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and could potentially result in
        unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option is to not
        reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed.

    CVE-2023-27538

        An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl where it
        reuses a previously established SSH connection despite the fact that an SSH
        option was modified, which should have prevented reuse. libcurl maintains a
        pool of previously used connections to reuse them for subsequent transfers
        if the configurations match. However, two SSH settings were omitted from
        the configuration check, allowing them to match easily, potentially leading
        to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    7.64.0-4+deb10u6.

    We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

    Version        : 2.4.38-3+deb10u10
    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-25690 CVE-2023-27522
    Debian Bug     : 1032476

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in apache2,
    a webserver that may be used as front-end proxy for other applications.
    These vulnerabilities may lead to HTTP request smuggling, and thus
    to front-end security controls being bypassed.

    Unfortunately, fixing these security vulnerabilities may require
    changes to configuration files. Some out-of-specification
    RewriteRule directives that were previously silently accepted,
    are now rejected with error AH10409. For instance, some RewriteRules
    that included a back-reference and the flags [L,NC] will need to
    be written with extra escaping flags such as [B= ?,BNP,QSA].

    CVE-2023-25690

      Some mod_proxy configurations allow an HTTP request Smuggling
      attack. Configurations are affected when mod_proxy is
      enabled along with some form of RewriteRule
      or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches
      some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL)
      data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target
      using variable substitution.

    CVE-2023-27522

        HTTP Response Smuggling in mod_proxy_uwsgi

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.4.38-3+deb10u10.

                     CVE-2022-45061
    Debian Bug     : 970099

    Multiple security issues were discovered in Python, an interactive
    high-level object-oriented language. An attacker may cause command
    injection, denial of service (DoS), request smuggling and port
    scanning.

    CVE-2015-20107

        The mailcap module does not add escape characters into commands
        discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to
        inject shell commands into applications that call
        mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of
        user-provided filenames or arguments).

    CVE-2019-20907

        In Lib/tarfile.py, an attacker is able to craft a TAR archive
        leading to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open, because
        _proc_pax lacks header validation.

    CVE-2020-8492

        Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
        of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
        urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

    CVE-2020-26116

        http.client allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the
        HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF
        control characters in the first argument of
        HTTPConnection.request.

    CVE-2021-3177

        Python has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c,
        which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python
        applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted
        input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to
        c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.

    CVE-2021-3733

        There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An
        attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client
        (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular
        Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication
        request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the
        server to the client.

    CVE-2021-3737

        An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of
        python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server,
        to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU
        time.

    CVE-2021-4189

        The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV (passive)
        mode trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw
        allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick
        FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and
        port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning
        ports. For the rare user who wants the previous behavior, set a
        `trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address` attribute on your `ftplib.FTP`
        instance to True.

    CVE-2022-45061

        An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when
        processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a
        crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder
        could lead to a CPU denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.7.16-2+deb10u2.

    We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

    Debian Bug     : 970099

    Multiple security issues were discovered in Python, an interactive
    high-level object-oriented language. An attacker may cause command
    injection, denial of service (DoS), request smuggling and port
    scanning.

    CVE-2015-20107

        The mailcap module does not add escape characters into commands
        discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to
        inject shell commands into applications that call
        mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of
        user-provided filenames or arguments).

    CVE-2019-20907

        In Lib/tarfile.py, an attacker is able to craft a TAR archive
        leading to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open, because
        _proc_pax lacks header validation.

    CVE-2020-8492

        Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
        of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
        urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

    CVE-2020-26116

        http.client allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the
        HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF
        control characters in the first argument of
        HTTPConnection.request.

    CVE-2021-3177

        Python has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c,
        which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python
        applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted
        input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to
        c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.

    CVE-2021-3733

        There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An
        attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client
        (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular
        Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication
        request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the
        server to the client.

    CVE-2021-3737

        An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of
        python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server,
        to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU
        time.

    CVE-2021-4189

        The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV (passive)
        mode trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw
        allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick
        FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and
        port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning
        ports. For the rare user who wants the previous behavior, set a
        `trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address` attribute on your `ftplib.FTP`
        instance to True.

    CVE-2022-45061

        An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when
        processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a
        crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder
        could lead to a CPU denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.7.16-2+deb10u2.

    We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

        In Lib/tarfile.py, an attacker is able to craft a TAR archive
        leading to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open, because
        _proc_pax lacks header validation.

    CVE-2020-8492

        Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
        of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
        urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

    CVE-2020-26116

        http.client allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the
        HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF
        control characters in the first argument of
        HTTPConnection.request.

    CVE-2021-3177

        Python has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c,
        which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python
        applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted
        input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to
        c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.

    CVE-2021-3733

        There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An
        attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client
        (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular
        Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication
        request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the
        server to the client.

    CVE-2021-3737

        An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of
        python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server,
        to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU
        time.

    CVE-2021-4189

        The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV (passive)
        mode trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw
        allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick
        FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and
        port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning
        ports. For the rare user who wants the previous behavior, set a
        `trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address` attribute on your `ftplib.FTP`
        instance to True.

    CVE-2022-45061

        An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when
        processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a
        crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder
        could lead to a CPU denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.7.16-2+deb10u2.

    Multiple security issues were discovered in Python, an interactive
    high-level object-oriented language. An attacker may cause command
    injection, denial of service (DoS), request smuggling and port
    scanning.

    CVE-2015-20107

        The mailcap module does not add escape characters into commands

                     CVE-2022-45061
    Debian Bug     : 970099

    Multiple security issues were discovered in Python, an interactive
    high-level object-oriented language. An attacker may cause command
    injection, denial of service (DoS), request smuggling and port
    scanning.

    CVE-2015-20107

        The mailcap module does not add escape characters into commands
        discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to
        inject shell commands into applications that call
        mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of
        user-provided filenames or arguments).

    CVE-2019-20907

        In Lib/tarfile.py, an attacker is able to craft a TAR archive
        leading to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open, because
        _proc_pax lacks header validation.

    CVE-2020-8492

        Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
        of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
        urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

    CVE-2020-26116

        http.client allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the
        HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF
        control characters in the first argument of
        HTTPConnection.request.

    CVE-2021-3177

        Python has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c,
        which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python
        applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted
        input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to
        c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.

    CVE-2021-3733

        There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An
        attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client
        (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular
        Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication
        request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the
        server to the client.

    CVE-2021-3737

        An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of
        python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server,
        to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU
        time.

    CVE-2021-4189

        The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV (passive)
        mode trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw
        allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick
        FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and
        port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning
        ports. For the rare user who wants the previous behavior, set a
        `trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address` attribute on your `ftplib.FTP`
        instance to True.

    CVE-2022-45061

        An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when
        processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a
        crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder
        could lead to a CPU denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.7.16-2+deb10u2.

    We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1034720

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
    Sockets Layer toolkit.

    CVE-2023-0464

        David Benjamin reported a flaw related to the verification of
        X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints, which
        may result in denial of service.

    CVE-2023-0465

        David Benjamin reported that invalid certificate policies in leaf
        certificates are silently ignored. A malicious CA could take
        advantage of this flaw to deliberately assert invalid certificate
        policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate
        altogether.

    CVE-2023-0466

        David Benjamin discovered that the implementation of the
        X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function does not enable the check
        which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to
        pass the certificate verification (contrary to its documentation).

    CVE-2023-2650

        It was discovered that processing malformed ASN.1 object
        identifiers or data may result in denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

    Debian Bug     : 1034720

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
    Sockets Layer toolkit.

    CVE-2023-0464

        David Benjamin reported a flaw related to the verification of
        X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints, which
        may result in denial of service.

    CVE-2023-0465

        David Benjamin reported that invalid certificate policies in leaf
        certificates are silently ignored. A malicious CA could take
        advantage of this flaw to deliberately assert invalid certificate
        policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate
        altogether.

    CVE-2023-0466

        David Benjamin discovered that the implementation of the
        X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function does not enable the check
        which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to
        pass the certificate verification (contrary to its documentation).

    CVE-2023-2650

        It was discovered that processing malformed ASN.1 object
        identifiers or data may result in denial of service.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1.1.1n-0+deb10u5.

    We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-38408
    Debian Bug     : 1042460

    It was discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled loading certain
    PKCS#11 providers. If a user forwarded their ssh-agent to an untrusted
    system, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to load
    arbitrary libraries from the users system and execute arbitrary code.

    In addition to the above security issue, this update also fixed
    another bug - bad interaction between the ssh_config ConnectTimeout
    and ConnectionAttempts directives - connection attempts after the
    first attempt were ignoring the requested timeout. More details about
    this can be found at https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2918.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    1:7.9p1-10+deb10u3.

    Debian Bug     : 932329 943562

    Vulnerabilities were found in libssh2, a client-side C library
    implementing the SSH2 protocol, which could lead to denial of service or
    remote information disclosure.

    CVE-2019-13115

        Kevin Backhouse discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in kex.c's
        kex_method_diffie_hellman_group_exchange_sha256_key_exchange()
        function, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way
        packets are read from the server.  A remote attacker who compromises
        an SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause
        a denial of service condition on the client system when a user
        connects to the server.

    CVE-2019-17498

        Kevin Backhouse discovered that the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in
        packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, thereby enabling
        an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a
        subsequent memory read.  A malicious SSH server may be able to
        disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service
        condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.

    CVE-2020-22218

        An issue was discovered in function _libssh2_packet_add(), which
        could allow attackers to access out of bounds memory.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2019-13115 CVE-2019-17498 CVE-2020-22218
    Debian Bug     : 932329 943562

    Vulnerabilities were found in libssh2, a client-side C library
    implementing the SSH2 protocol, which could lead to denial of service or
    remote information disclosure.

    CVE-2019-13115

        Kevin Backhouse discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in kex.c's
        kex_method_diffie_hellman_group_exchange_sha256_key_exchange()
        function, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way
        packets are read from the server.  A remote attacker who compromises
        an SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause
        a denial of service condition on the client system when a user
        connects to the server.

    CVE-2019-17498

        Kevin Backhouse discovered that the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in
        packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, thereby enabling
        an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a
        subsequent memory read.  A malicious SSH server may be able to
        disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service
        condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.

    CVE-2020-22218

        An issue was discovered in function _libssh2_packet_add(), which
        could allow attackers to access out of bounds memory.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1.8.0-2.1+deb10u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your libssh2 packages.

                     CVE-2022-48566 CVE-2023-24329 CVE-2023-40217

    This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities concerning the urlparse module as
    well as vulnerabilities concerning the heapq, hmac, plistlib and ssl modules.

    CVE-2021-23336

        Python was vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urlparse.parse_qsl and
        urlparse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the
        attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
        cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy
        (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in
        malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would
        usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not
        include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

    CVE-2022-0391

        The urlparse module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into
        components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize
        input and allows characters like '\r' and '\n' in the URL path.  This flaw
        allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks.

    CVE-2022-48560

        A use-after-free exists in Python via heappushpop in heapq.

    CVE-2022-48565

        An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python.  The plistlib
        module no longer accepts entity declarations in XML plist files to avoid
        XML vulnerabilities.

    CVE-2022-48566

        An issue was discovered in compare_digest in Lib/hmac.py in Python.
        Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the accumulator
        variable in hmac.compare_digest.

    CVE-2023-24329

        An issue in the urlparse component of Python allows attackers to bypass
        blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.

    CVE-2023-40217

        The issue primarily affects servers written in Python (such as HTTP
        servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is
        created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly,
        there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket
        as not connected and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will
        still be readable from the socket buffer.  This data will not be
        authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate
        authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data
        is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS
        connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the
        vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on
        initialization of the SSLSocket.)


    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.7.16-2+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

    CVE-2022-48566

        An issue was discovered in compare_digest in Lib/hmac.py in Python.
        Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the accumulator
        variable in hmac.compare_digest.

    CVE-2023-24329

        An issue in the urlparse component of Python allows attackers to bypass
        blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.

    CVE-2023-40217

        The issue primarily affects servers written in Python (such as HTTP
        servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is
        created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly,
        there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket
        as not connected and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will
        still be readable from the socket buffer.  This data will not be
        authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate
        authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data
        is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS
        connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the
        vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on
        initialization of the SSLSocket.)

    This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities concerning the urlparse module as
    well as vulnerabilities concerning the heapq, hmac, plistlib and ssl modules.

    CVE-2021-23336

        Python was vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urlparse.parse_qsl and
        urlparse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the
        attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
        cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy
        (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in
        malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would
        usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not
        include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

    CVE-2022-0391

        The urlparse module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into
        components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize
        input and allows characters like '\r' and '\n' in the URL path.  This flaw
        allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks.

    CVE-2022-48560

        A use-after-free exists in Python via heappushpop in heapq.

    CVE-2022-48565

        An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python.  The plistlib
        module no longer accepts entity declarations in XML plist files to avoid

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-28321 CVE-2023-38546

    Two security issues were found in Curl, an easy-to-use client-side URL
    transfer library and command line tool.

    CVE-2023-28321

        Hiroki Kurosawa found that curl could mismatch hostnames with
        wildcards when using its own name matching function.

    CVE-2023-38546

        It was discovered that under some circumstances libcurl was
        susceptible to cookie injection.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

    Package        : ncurses
    Version        : 6.1+20181013-2+deb10u5
    CVE ID         : CVE-2021-39537 CVE-2023-29491
    Debian Bug     : 1034372

    Issues were found in ncurses, a collection of shared libraries for
    terminal handling, which could lead to denial of service.

    CVE-2021-39537

        It has been discovered that the tic(1) utility is susceptible to a
        heap overflow on crafted input due to improper bounds checking.

    CVE-2023-29491

        Jonathan Bar Or, Michael Pearse and Emanuele Cozzi have discovered
        that when ncurses is used by a setuid application, a local user can
        trigger security-relevant memory corruption via malformed data in a
        terminfo database file found in $HOME/.terminfo or reached via the
        TERMINFO or TERM environment variables.

        In order to mitigate this issue, ncurses now further restricts
        programs running with elevated privileges (setuid/setgid programs).
        Programs run by the superuser remain able to load custom terminfo
        entries.

        This change aligns ncurses' behavior in buster-security with that of
        Debian Bullseye's latest point release (6.2+20201114-2+deb11u2).

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    6.1+20181013-2+deb10u5.

    We recommend that you upgrade your ncurses packages.

    Package        : ncurses
    Version        : 6.1+20181013-2+deb10u5
    CVE ID         : CVE-2021-39537 CVE-2023-29491
    Debian Bug     : 1034372

    Issues were found in ncurses, a collection of shared libraries for
    terminal handling, which could lead to denial of service.

    CVE-2021-39537

        It has been discovered that the tic(1) utility is susceptible to a
        heap overflow on crafted input due to improper bounds checking.

    CVE-2023-29491

        Jonathan Bar Or, Michael Pearse and Emanuele Cozzi have discovered
        that when ncurses is used by a setuid application, a local user can
        trigger security-relevant memory corruption via malformed data in a
        terminfo database file found in $HOME/.terminfo or reached via the
        TERMINFO or TERM environment variables.

        In order to mitigate this issue, ncurses now further restricts
        programs running with elevated privileges (setuid/setgid programs).
        Programs run by the superuser remain able to load custom terminfo
        entries.

        This change aligns ncurses' behavior in buster-security with that of
        Debian Bullseye's latest point release (6.2+20201114-2+deb11u2).

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    6.1+20181013-2+deb10u5.

    We recommend that you upgrade your ncurses packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-27534

    curl was affected by a path traversal vulnerability.
    SFTP implementation causes the tilde (~) character to be wrongly
    replaced when used as a prefix in the first path element,
    in addition to its intended use as the first element to indicate
    a path relative to the user's home directory. Attackers can exploit
    this flaw to bypass filtering or execute arbitrary code by
    crafting a path like /~2/foo while accessing a server with
    a specific user.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-52425
    Debian Bug     : 1063238

    Expat, an XML parsing C library has been found to have an vulnerability
    that allows an attacker to perform a denial of service (resource
    consumption, when many full reparsings are required in the case of a
    large tokens.

    When parsing a really big token that requires multiple buffer fills to
    complete, expat has to re-parse the token from start multiple times,
    which takes time. These patches introduce a heuristic that, when having
    failed on the same token multiple times, defers further parsing until
    there's significantly more data available.

    The patch also introduces an optiional API,
    XML_SetReparseDeferralEnabled(), to disable the new heuristic.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    2.2.6-2+deb10u7.

    We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2024-28182
    Debian Bug     : 1068415

    Bartek Nowotarskis discovered that nghttp2, a set of programs
    implementing the HTTP/2, keeps reading CONTINUATION frames even after a
    stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync.  This causes excessive
    CPU usage to decode HPACK stream, which could lead to Denial of Service.

    The issue is mitigated by limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames it
    can accept after a HEADERS frame.  The limit is configurable and
    defaults to 8.

    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
    1.36.0-2+deb10u3.

    We recommend that you upgrade your nghttp2 packages.

    CVE ID         : CVE-2023-50387 CVE-2023-50868
    Debian Bug     :

    Two vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server implementation, which
    may result in denial of service.

    CVE-2023-50387

        Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol allow remote attackers to cause
        a denial of service via DNSSEC queries. This is known as the KeyTrap
        issue.

    CVE-2023-50868

        The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol allows remote
        attackers to cause a denial of service via DNSSEC queries in a random
        subdomain attack. This is known as the NSEC3 issue.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u11.

    We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1068412

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Apache HTTP server,
    which may result in HTTP response splitting, denial of service, or
    authorization bypass.

    CVE-2019-17567

         mod_proxy_wstunnel configured on an URL that is not
         necessarily Upgraded by the origin server was tunneling
         the whole connection regardless, thus allowing for subsequent requests
         on the same connection to pass through with no HTTP validation,
         authentication or authorization possibly configured.

    CVE-2023-31122

        An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability was found in mod_macro.

    CVE-2023-38709

        A faulty input validation was found in the core of Apache
        that allows malicious or exploitable backend/content generators
        to split HTTP responses.

    CVE-2023-45802

        When an HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a
        time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed
        immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close.
        A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection
        busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing.
        On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process
        might run out of memory before that.

    CVE-2024-24795

        HTTP Response splitting in multiple modules in Apache HTTP Server
        allows an attacker that can inject malicious response headers into
        backend applications to cause an HTTP desynchronization attack.

    CVE-2024-27316

        HTTP/2 incoming headers exceeding the limit are temporarily
        buffered in nghttp2 in order to generate an informative HTTP
        413 response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this
        leads to memory exhaustion.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.4.59-1~deb10u1.

    Please note that the fix of CVE-2024-24795, may break unrelated
    CGI-BIN scripts. As part of the security fix, the Apache webserver
    mod_cgi module has stopped relaying the Content-Length field
    of the HTTP reply header from the CGI programs back to the client
    in cases where the connection is to be closed and the client
    is able to read until end-of-file. You may restore legacy
    behavior for trusted scripts by adding the following configuration
    environment variable to the
    Apache configuration, scoped to the <Directory> entry or
    entries in which scripts are being served via CGI,
    SetEnv ap_trust_cgilike_cl yes.
    The definitive fix is to read the whole input,
    re-allocating the input buffer to fit as more input is received
    in CGI-BIN scripts, and and to not trust that
    CONTENT_LENGTH variable is always present.

    We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1068412

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Apache HTTP server,
    which may result in HTTP response splitting, denial of service, or
    authorization bypass.

    CVE-2019-17567

         mod_proxy_wstunnel configured on an URL that is not
         necessarily Upgraded by the origin server was tunneling
         the whole connection regardless, thus allowing for subsequent requests
         on the same connection to pass through with no HTTP validation,
         authentication or authorization possibly configured.

    CVE-2023-31122

        An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability was found in mod_macro.

    CVE-2023-38709

        A faulty input validation was found in the core of Apache
        that allows malicious or exploitable backend/content generators
        to split HTTP responses.

    CVE-2023-45802

        When an HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a
        time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed
        immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close.
        A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection
        busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing.
        On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process
        might run out of memory before that.

    CVE-2024-24795

        HTTP Response splitting in multiple modules in Apache HTTP Server
        allows an attacker that can inject malicious response headers into
        backend applications to cause an HTTP desynchronization attack.

    CVE-2024-27316

        HTTP/2 incoming headers exceeding the limit are temporarily
        buffered in nghttp2 in order to generate an informative HTTP
        413 response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this
        leads to memory exhaustion.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    2.4.59-1~deb10u1.

    Please note that the fix of CVE-2024-24795, may break unrelated
    CGI-BIN scripts. As part of the security fix, the Apache webserver
    mod_cgi module has stopped relaying the Content-Length field
    of the HTTP reply header from the CGI programs back to the client
    in cases where the connection is to be closed and the client
    is able to read until end-of-file. You may restore legacy
    behavior for trusted scripts by adding the following configuration
    environment variable to the
    Apache configuration, scoped to the <Directory> entry or
    entries in which scripts are being served via CGI,
    SetEnv ap_trust_cgilike_cl yes.
    The definitive fix is to read the whole input,
    re-allocating the input buffer to fit as more input is received
    in CGI-BIN scripts, and and to not trust that
    CONTENT_LENGTH variable is always present.

    We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1034835 1071160

    Multiple vulnerabilities were found in git, a fast, scalable and
    distributed revision control system.

    CVE-2019-1387

        It was possible to bypass the previous check for this vulnerability
        using parallel cloning, or the --recurse-submodules option to
        git-checkout(1).

    CVE-2023-25652

        Feeding specially-crafted input to 'git apply --reject' could
        overwrite a path outside the working tree with partially controlled
        contents, corresponding to the rejected hunk or hunks from the given
        patch.

    CVE-2023-25815

        Low-privileged users could inject malicious messages into Git's
        output under MINGW.

    CVE-2023-29007

        A specially-crafted .gitmodules file with submodule URLs longer than
        1024 characters could be used to inject arbitrary configuration into
        $GIT_DIR/config.

    CVE-2024-32002

        Repositories with submodules could be specially-crafted to write
        hooks into .git/ which would then be executed during an ongoing
        clone operation.

    CVE-2024-32004

        A specially-crafted local repository could cause the execution of
        arbitrary code when cloned by another user.

    CVE-2024-32021

        When cloning a local repository that contains symlinks via the
        filesystem, Git could have created hardlinks to arbitrary
        user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository
        in the objects/ directory.

    CVE-2024-32465

        When cloning a local repository obtained from a downloaded archive,
        hooks in that repository could be used for arbitrary code execution.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:2.20.1-2+deb10u9.

    We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.

    Debian Bug     : 1034835 1071160

    Multiple vulnerabilities were found in git, a fast, scalable and
    distributed revision control system.

    CVE-2019-1387

        It was possible to bypass the previous check for this vulnerability
        using parallel cloning, or the --recurse-submodules option to
        git-checkout(1).

    CVE-2023-25652

        Feeding specially-crafted input to 'git apply --reject' could
        overwrite a path outside the working tree with partially controlled
        contents, corresponding to the rejected hunk or hunks from the given
        patch.

    CVE-2023-25815

        Low-privileged users could inject malicious messages into Git's
        output under MINGW.

    CVE-2023-29007

        A specially-crafted .gitmodules file with submodule URLs longer than
        1024 characters could be used to inject arbitrary configuration into
        $GIT_DIR/config.

    CVE-2024-32002

        Repositories with submodules could be specially-crafted to write
        hooks into .git/ which would then be executed during an ongoing
        clone operation.

    CVE-2024-32004

        A specially-crafted local repository could cause the execution of
        arbitrary code when cloned by another user.

    CVE-2024-32021

        When cloning a local repository that contains symlinks via the
        filesystem, Git could have created hardlinks to arbitrary
        user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository
        in the objects/ directory.

    CVE-2024-32465

        When cloning a local repository obtained from a downloaded archive,
        hooks in that repository could be used for arbitrary code execution.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:2.20.1-2+deb10u9.

    We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.

    Debian Bug     : 995130

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSH, an implementation of
    the SSH protocol suite.

    CVE-2021-41617

        It was discovered that sshd failed to correctly initialise supplemental
        groups when executing an AuthorizedKeysCommand or
        AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand, where a AuthorizedKeysCommandUser or
        AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser directive has been set to run the command
        as a different user. Instead these commands would inherit the groups that
        sshd was started with.

    CVE-2023-48795

        Fabian Baeumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Joerg Schwenk discovered that the SSH
        protocol is prone to a prefix truncation attack, known as the Terrapin
        attack. This attack allows a MITM attacker to effect a limited break of the
        integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra
        messages prior to the commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal
        number of consecutive messages immediately after encryption starts.

        Details can be found at https://terrapin-attack.com/

    CVE-2023-51385

        It was discovered that if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell
        metacharacters was passed to ssh, and a ProxyCommand, LocalCommand
        directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via
        expansion tokens, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary
        user/hostnames to ssh could potentially perform command injection. The
        situation could arise in case of git repositories with submodules, where the
        repository could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user or
        hostname.

    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
    1:7.9p1-10+deb10u4.

    We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.
