target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to
connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on
the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to
authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication
that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the
provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been
invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with
the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental
issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid
credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error
details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be
executed.","","
